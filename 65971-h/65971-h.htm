<small>ACROSS THE SPACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THEIR first sight of each other&mdash;Red and Black&mdash;was
across the space which stretches between pulpit and
pew. It&#8217;s sometimes a wide space, and impassable; again,
it&#8217;s not far, and the lines of communication are always
open. In this case, neither of them knew, as yet, just
what the distance was.</p>

<p>Black&mdash;Robert McPherson Black&mdash;if you want his full
name, had been a bit nervous in the vestry where he put
on his gown. He had been preaching only five years, and
that in a Southern country parish, when a visiting committee
of impressive looking men had come to listen to him&mdash;had
come again&mdash;and once more&mdash;and then had startled
him with a call to the big suburban town and the fine
old, ivy-grown church generally known as the &#8220;Stone
Church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, gentlemen,&#8221; he had said, swinging about quickly
in his study chair when Mr. Lockhart, the chairman of the
committee, had asked him if he would consider a call&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;why,
I&#8217;m not good enough for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The committee had smiled&mdash;it was quite a remarkable
committee, and had a sense of humour. At least Samuel
Lockhart had, and one other of the five who were waiting
upon Mr. Black in his study after the evening service.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>&#8220;Meaning virtue&mdash;or ability?&#8221; inquired the chairman,
with his friendly smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both. You see&mdash;well, to put it honestly&mdash;I&#8217;m just
a country boy as yet, born in Scotland and brought up in
your South. I haven&#8217;t had the training&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good things have come out of the country&mdash;and
Scotland&mdash;and the South,&#8221; Mr. John Radway had suggested.
&#8220;And I believe you are a graduate of&mdash;a perfectly
satisfactory college and seminary, and have built this
church up from desertion to popularity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, they had had it out on those lines, and others, in
the next hour, the committee falling more and more in love
with its candidate&mdash;if so emotional a phrase may be used
of the feelings stirred in the breasts of five middle-aged,
steady-going, sensible men&mdash;as they watched the young
man&#8217;s face go from pale to red and back again, and heard
him tell them not only what he thought he was not, but
what he thought they might not be either&mdash;in so frank and
winning a way that the more he wasn&#8217;t sure he&#8217;d better
come the surer they were he must!</p>

<p>In the end he came&mdash;called and accepted, after the modern
methods, wholly on the judgment of the committee,
for he had refused absolutely and finally to come and
preach a candidating sermon. So when he emerged from
the vestry door, on that first May Sunday, he faced for
the first time his newly acquired congregation, and the
church faced for the first time its minister-elect. Which
was wholly as it should be, and the result was a tremendously
large audience, on tiptoe with interest and curiosity.</p>

<p>Red was not in the congregation when Black first came
in through the vestry door. Instead, as usual, he was
racing along the road in a very muddy car, trying to make
four calls in the time in which he should really have made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
two, because his wife had insisted very strenuously that
he should do his best to get to church on that particular
morning. It seemed that she had learned that the new
minister was from the South, and she, being a Southerner,
naturally felt an instant sense of loyalty. It was mighty
seldom that Red could ever be got to church, not so much
because he didn&#8217;t want to go&mdash;though he didn&#8217;t, really, unless
the man he was to hear was exceptionally good&mdash;as because
he couldn&#8217;t get around to it, not once in a blue moon&mdash;or
a Sunday morning sun. And if, by strenuous exertion,
he did arrive at church, there was one thing which almost
invariably happened&mdash;so what was the use? The young
usher for Doctor Burns&#8217; aisle always grinned when he saw
him come in, because he knew perfectly that within a very
short time, he, the usher, would be tiptoeing down the
aisle and whispering in the ear below the heavy thatch of
close-cropped, fire-red hair. And then Doctor Burns&#8217;
attending church for <i>that</i> day would be over.</p>

<p>The chances seemed fair, however, on this particular
morning, because Red did not come into church till the
preliminary service was well along. He stole in while the
congregation was on its feet singing a hymn, so his entrance
was not conspicuous; but Black saw him, just the same.
Black had already seen every man in the congregation,
though he had noted individually but few of the women.
He saw this big figure, stalwart yet well set up; he saw the
red head&mdash;he could hardly help that&mdash;it would be a landmark
in any audience. He saw also the brilliant hazel
eyes, the strong yet finely cut face. To put it in a word,
as Redfield Pepper Burns came into the crowded church,
his personality reached out ahead of him and struck the
man in the pulpit a heavy blow over the heart. Too
strong a phrase? Not a bit of it. If the thing has never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
happened to you, then you&#8217;re not a witness, and your testimony
doesn&#8217;t count. But plenty of witnesses can be
found.</p>

<p>Robert Black looked down the aisle, and instantly coveted
this man for a friend. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to have you,&#8221; he
said within himself, while the people went on singing the
last stanza of a great hymn. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to have you for
a friend. I don&#8217;t know who else may be in this parish
but as long as <i>you&#8217;re</i> here there&#8217;ll be something worth the
very best I can do. I wonder if you&#8217;ll be easy to get. I&mdash;doubt
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this was rather strange, for the family with whom
he was staying while the manse was being put in order for
the new minister had spoken warmly of Doctor Burns as
the man whom they always employed, plainly showing
their affection for him, and adding that half the town
adored the red-headed person in question. When that
red head came into church late, looking as professional as
such a man can&#8217;t possibly help looking, it was easy enough
for Black to guess that this was Doctor Burns.</p>

<p>Across the space, then, they faced each other, these two,
whose lives were to react so powerfully, each upon the
other&mdash;and only one of them guessed it. To tell the truth,
Red was more than a little weary that Sunday morning;
he was not just then electrically sensitive, like the other
man, to every impression&mdash;he was not that sort of man,
anyhow. He had been up half the night, and his hair-trigger
temper&mdash;which had inspired the nickname he had
carried from boyhood&mdash;had gone off in a loud explosion
within less than an hour before he appeared in the church.
He was still inwardly seething slightly at the recollection,
though outwardly he had returned to calm. Altogether,
he was not precisely in a state of mind to gaze with favour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
upon the new man in the pulpit, who struck him at once as
disappointingly young. He had been told by somebody
that Robert McPherson Black was thirty-five, but his
first swift glance convinced him that Robert had not
been strictly truthful about his age&mdash;or else had encouraged
an impression that anybody with half an eye could
see was a wrong one. He was quite evidently a boy&mdash;a
mere boy. Burns liked boys&mdash;but not in the pulpit, attempting
to take charge of his life and tell him what to do.</p>

<p>Therefore Red looked with an indifferent eye upon the
tall figure standing to read the Scriptures, but acknowledged
in his mind that the youth had a pleasing face and personality&mdash;Red
liked black hair and eyes&mdash;he had married
them, and had never ceased to prefer that colouring to any
other. He admitted to himself that the intonations of
Black&#8217;s voice were surprisingly deep and manly for such
a boy&mdash;and then promptly closed his mind to further
impressions, and ran his hand through his red hair and
breathed a heavy sigh of fatigue. Vigorous fellow though
he was at forty years, it was necessary for him to get an occasional
night&#8217;s sleep to even things up. If it hadn&#8217;t been
for his wife&#8217;s urging he might have been snatching forty
winks this minute on a certain comfortable wide davenport
at home. These Southerners&mdash;how they did hang
together&mdash;and Black wasn&#8217;t a real Southerner, either,
having spent his boyhood in Scotland. Red could have
heard the new man quite as well next Sunday&mdash;or the one
after. He glanced sidewise at his wife, and his irritation
faded&mdash;as it always did at the mere sight of her. How
lovely she was this morning, in her quiet church attire.
Bless her heart&mdash;if she wanted him there he was glad he
had come. And of course it was best for the children
that they see their father in church now and then....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
But he hoped the boy in the pulpit would not make too
long a prayer&mdash;he, Red, was so deadly sleepy, he might
go to sleep and disgrace Ellen. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first
time.</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t hear the prayer&mdash;and not because he went
to sleep. It was during the offertory sung by the expensive
quartette (which he didn&#8217;t like at all because he knew the
tenor for a four-flusher and the contralto for a little blonde
fool, who sometimes got him up in the night for her hysterics&mdash;though
he admitted she could sing), that the
young usher came tiptoeing down the aisle and whispered
the customary message in the ear beneath the red thatch.
Dr. Redfield Pepper Burns had been in church precisely
eleven minutes this time before being called out. What
in thunder was the use of his coming at all? He gave an
I-told-you-so look at his wife as he got up and hung his
overcoat on his arm and went up the aisle again, his competent
shoulders followed by the disappointed gaze of
Black from the pulpit. The doors closed behind him,
and the young usher exhibited his watch triumphantly
to another young usher, making signs as of one who had
won a bet. Eleven minutes was the shortest time since
February, when on a certain remembered Sunday Burns
had never got to his seat at all, but had been followed
down the aisle by the usher practically on a run. Somebody
had got himself smashed up by a passing trolley almost
outside the door of the sanctuary. Being an usher
certainly had its compensations at times.</p>

<p>Yes, Black was disappointed. Of course he faced a large
and interested congregation, and everybody knows that a
minister should not be more anxious to preach to one man
than to another. Unfortunately, being quite human, he
sometimes is. On this occasion, having suffered that blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
over the heart before mentioned, he had found himself
suddenly peculiarly eager to speak to the red-headed
doctor&mdash;from the pulpit&mdash;and convince him that he himself
was not as young as he looked&mdash;and that he could be a
very good friend. Red looked to him like the sort of man
who needed a friend, in spite of all Black&#8217;s hostess had said
to him about Burns&#8217; popularity and his enormous professional
practice. During those eleven minutes, through
part of which Black had been at leisure to glance several
times at Red, he had received the distinct impression
that he was looking at a much overworked man, who
needed certain things rather badly&mdash;one of which was another
man who was not just a good-fellow sort of friend,
but one who understood at least a little of what life meant&mdash;and
what it ought to mean.</p>

<p>Thus thinking Black rose to make his prayer&mdash;the
prayer before the sermon. His thoughts about Red had
made him forget for a little that he was facing his new
congregation&mdash;and that was a good thing, for it had taken
away most of his nervousness. And after the prayer
came the sermon&mdash;and after the sermon came a very
wonderful strain of music which made Black lift his head
toward the choir above him with a sense of deep gratitude
that music existed and could help him in his task like that.
At this time, of course, he didn&#8217;t know about the &#8220;four-flusher&#8221;
tenor, and the little fool of a blonde contralto
who always felt most like smiling at the moment when he
was preaching most earnestly. When he did know&mdash;well&mdash;in
the end there were two new members of that
quartette.</p>

<p>So this was how Black and Red met for the first time&mdash;yet
did not meet. Though, after the seeing of Red across
the as yet undetermined distance between pulpit and pew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
there followed a thousand other impressions, and though
after the service Black met any number of interesting looking
men and women who shook his hand and gave him
cordial welcome, the memory he carried away with him
was that of R. P. Burns, M.D., as the man he must at any
cost come to know intimately.</p>

<p>As for Red&mdash;his impression was another story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how did the Kid acquit himself?&#8221; he inquired,
when he met his family at the customary early afternoon
Sunday dinner. There was quite a group about the
table, for his wife&#8217;s sister, Martha Macauley, her husband,
James Macauley, and their children were there. All these
people had been present at the morning service.</p>

<p>Macauley, ever first to reply to any question addressed
to a company in general, spoke jeeringly, turning his
round, good-humoured face toward his host:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not fee young Perkins to leave you in your pew
for once, and hear for yourself? I&#8217;ve known you turn
down plenty of calls when they took you away from home,
but, come to think of it, I never knew you to refuse to cut
and run from church!&#8221;</p>

<p>Burns frowned. &#8220;You&#8217;re not such a devoted worshipper
yourself, Jim, that you can act truant officer and get
away with it. If you knew how I hated to move out of
that pew this morning&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;d got all set for one of those head-up snoozes
you take when the sermon bores you. Well, let me tell
you, if you&#8217;d stayed, you wouldn&#8217;t have got any chance
to sleep. He may be a kid&mdash;though he doesn&#8217;t look so
much like one when you get close&mdash;lines in his face if you
notice&mdash;he may be a kid, but he&#8217;s got the goods, and by
George, he delivered &#8217;em this morning all right. Sleep!
I wasn&#8217;t over and above wide awake myself through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
preliminaries, but I found myself sitting up with a jerk
when he let go his first bolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bolt, eh?&#8221; Burns began to eat his soup with relish.
As it happened he had had no time for breakfast, and this
was his first meal of the day. &#8220;Jolly, this <i>is</i> good soup!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Well!&mdash;I thought they always spoke softly
when they first came, and only fired up later. Didn&#8217;t he
begin on the &#8216;Dear Brethren, I&#8217;m pleased to be with you&#8217;
line? I thought he looked rather conventional myself&mdash;and
abominably young. I&#8217;m not fond of green salad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Green salad!&#8221; This was Martha Macauley, flushing
and indignant. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s a <i>man</i>, Red, and a very fine
one, if I&#8217;m any judge. And he can preach&mdash;oh, how he
<i>can</i> preach!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking any woman, Marty.&#8221; Burns gave his
sister-in-law a cynical little smile. &#8220;Trust any woman
to fall for a handsome young preacher with black eyes
and a good voice, whatever he says. To be sure, Ellen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;you think Ellen is the only woman in the
world with any sense. Well, let me tell you Len &#8216;fell
for him,&#8217; just as much as I did&mdash;only she never gives
herself away, and probably won&#8217;t now, if you ask her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burns&#8217; eyes met his wife&#8217;s. &#8220;Like him, eh, Len?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Did the black eyes&mdash;and his being a Southerner&mdash;get
you, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Redfield Pepper Burns was an unusual woman.
If she had not been, at this challenge, she would have
answered one of two things. Either she would have said
defiantly: &#8220;I certainly did like him&mdash;why shouldn&#8217;t I,
when Jim did&mdash;and <i>he&#8217;s</i> a man! Why are you always
prejudiced against ministers?&#8221; or she would have said
softly: &#8220;If you had heard him, dear, I think you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
have liked him yourself.&#8221; Instead she answered, as a
man might&mdash;only she was not in the least like a man&mdash;&#8220;It&#8217;s
hard to tell how one likes any minister at first sight.
It&#8217;s not the first sermon, but the twentieth, that tells the
story. And plenty of other things besides the preaching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you certainly got a good first impression, Len?&#8221;
Martha cried, at the same moment that James Macauley
chuckled, &#8220;My, but that was a clever stall!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns smiled at her husband, whose hazel eyes
were studying her intently. Red never ceased to wonder
at the way people didn&#8217;t succeed in cornering Ellen. She
might find her way out with a smile alone, or with a flash
of those wonderful black-lashed eyes of hers, but find her
way out she always did. She found it now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Lockhart told me confidentially this morning
that Mr. Black said he wasn&#8217;t good enough for us. So
at least we have been forewarned. He&#8217;ll have to prove
himself against his own admission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t good enough, eh?&#8221; growled Red Pepper, suddenly
and characteristically striking fire. &#8220;Did he think
we wanted a &#8216;good one&#8217;&mdash;a saint? I don&#8217;t, for one. My
principal objection to him, without having heard him, is
that he looks as if his mother parted his hair for him before
he came, and put a clean handkerchief in his pocket.
Jolly&mdash;I like &#8217;em to look less like poets and more like red-blooded
men! Not that I want &#8217;em beefy, either. Speaking
of beef&mdash;I&#8217;ll have another slice. This going to church
takes it out of a fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jim Macauley howled. &#8220;Going to church! Coming
away, you mean. Just a look-in, for yours. As to the
way you like your preachers, my private opinion is you
don&#8217;t like &#8217;em at all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;Mr. Black doesn&#8217;t look like a poet, Red.&#8221; It was
Martha Macauley again. She and her brother-in-law seldom
agreed upon any topic. &#8220;He has the jolliest twinkle
in those black eyes&mdash;and his hair is so crisp with trying
to curl that it doesn&#8217;t stay parted well at all&mdash;it was all
rumpled up before the end of his sermon. And he has a
fine, healthy colour&mdash;and the nicest smile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Burns sighed. &#8220;Jim, suppose there was a man up for
the governorship in our state, and we went around talking
about his eyes and his hair and his smile! Oh, Christopher!
Don&#8217;t you women ever think about a man&#8217;s <i>brains</i>?&mdash;what
he has <i>in</i> his head&mdash;not <i>on</i> it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was you who began to talk about his looks!&#8221; Mrs.
Macauley pointed out triumphantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Check!&#8221; called James, her husband. &#8220;She scores,
Red! You did begin a lot of pretty mean personal observations
about his mother parting his hair, and so forth.
Shame!&mdash;it wasn&#8217;t sporting of you. The preacher has
brains, brother&mdash;brains, I tell you. I saw &#8217;em myself,
through his skull. And he&#8217;s got a pretty little muscle,
too. When he gripped my hand I felt the bones crack&mdash;and
me a golf player. I don&#8217;t know where he got his&mdash;but
he&#8217;s got it. These athletic parsons&mdash;look out for
&#8217;em. They&#8217;re liable to turn the other cheek, according
to instructions in the Scriptures, and then hit you a crack
with a good right arm. It struck me this chap hadn&#8217;t
been sitting on cushions all his life. You&#8217;ll outweigh him
by about fifty pounds, but I&#8217;ll bet he could down you in a
wrestling match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;d like to see him do it,&#8221; murmured
Red Pepper, becoming genial again under the influence
of his second cup of very strong coffee, which was banishing
his weariness like magic, as usual. &#8220;Well, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
won&#8217;t right away, because we&#8217;re not likely to get to that
stage of intimacy for some time. Ministers and doctors
meet mostly in places where each has a good chance to criticize
the other&#8217;s job. When I come to die I&#8217;d rather have
my old friend, Max Buller, M.D., to say a prayer for me&mdash;if
he knows how&mdash;than any preacher who ever came down
the pike&mdash;except one, and that was a corking old bishop
who was the best sport I ever met in my life. Oh, it isn&#8217;t
that I don&#8217;t respect the profession&mdash;I do. But I want a
minister to be a man as well, and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t quite fair to take it for granted that he
isn&#8217;t one, is it, Red?&#8221; inquired the charming woman
at the other side of the table who was his wife.</p>

<p>James Macauley laughed. &#8220;Innocent of not being a
man till he&#8217;s proved guilty, eh, Red?&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;You know I really have quite a strong suspicion that
this particular minister is a regular fellow. The way he
looked me in the eye&mdash;well&mdash;I may be no judge of men&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not,&#8221; declared his opponent, frankly. &#8220;Any
chap with a cheerful grin and a plausible line of talk can
put it all over you. You&#8217;re too good-natured to live.
Now me&mdash;I&#8217;m a natural born cynic&mdash;I see too many faces
with the mask off not to be. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>you</i>! You&#8217;re the kind of cynic who&#8217;d sit up all
night with a preacher or any other man you happened to
hate, and save his life, and then floor him the first time
you met him afterward by telling him you hadn&#8217;t any bill
against him because you weren&#8217;t a vet&#8217;rinary and didn&#8217;t
charge for treating donkeys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call that a joke&mdash;or an insult?&#8221; growled Red Pepper;
then laughed and switched the subject.</p>

<p>But next Sunday he did not see fit to get to church
at all, and on the following Sunday he couldn&#8217;t have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
done it if he&#8217;d tried, not having a minute to breathe in for
himself while fighting like a fiend to keep the breath of
life in a fellow-human. And between times he caught
not a sight of Robert Black, who, however, caught
several sights of him. R. P. Burns was in the habit of
driving with his face straight ahead, to avoid bowing
every other minute to his myriad acquaintances and patients.
Though Black tried very hard more than once
to catch his eye when passing him close by the curb, he
had a view only of the clean-cut profile, the lips usually
close set, the brows drawn over the intent eyes. For
Red was accustomed to think out his operative cases while
on the road, and when a man is mentally making incisions,
tying arteries, and blocking out the shortest cut to a cure,
he has little time to be recognizing passing citizens, not to
mention a preacher whom he persists in considering too
much of a &#8220;kid&#8221; for his taste, in the pulpit or out of it.</p>

<p>But Black, as you have been told, was of Scottish blood,
and a Scot bides his time. Black meant to know Red, and
know him well. He was pretty sure that the way to know
him was not to go and hang around his office, or to call
upon his wife with Red sure to be away&mdash;as Black discovered
he always was, in ordinary calling hours. He
knew he couldn&#8217;t go and lay his hand on Red&#8217;s shoulder
at a street corner and tell him he wanted to know him. In
fact, neither these nor any other of the ordinary methods
of bringing about an acquaintance with a man as a preliminary
to a friendship seemed to him to promise well. The
best he could do was to wait and watch an opportunity,
and then&mdash;well&mdash;if he could somehow do something to
help Red out in a crisis, or even to serve him in some really
significant way without making any fuss about it, he felt
that possibly the thing he desired might come about.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Meanwhile&mdash;that blow over the heart which he had received
at the first sight of the big red-headed doctor continued
to make itself felt. Therefore, while Black went
with a will at all the new duties of his large parish, and
made friends right and left&mdash;particularly with his men,
because he liked men and found it easier to get on with
them than with women&mdash;he did not for a day relax his
watch for the time when he should send a counter blow in
under the guard which he somehow felt was up against
him, or forget to plan to make it a telling one when he
should deliver it.</p>

<small>HEADLINES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HARPS and voices!&#8221; ejaculated Robert Black, quite
unconscious of the source of his poetic expletive,
&#8220;how are my poor little two hundred and thirty-one
books going to make any kind of a showing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Small wonder that he looked dismayed. He had just
caught his first sight of the dignified manse study, with
its long rows of empty black walnut bookcases stretching,
five shelves high, across three sides of the large room.
The manse, fortunately for a bachelor, was furnished
as to the main necessities of living, but it wanted all the
details which go to make a home. Though the study contained
a massive black walnut desk and chair, a big
leather armchair, a luxurious leather couch, and a very
good and ecclesiastically sombre rug upon its floor, it
seemed bare enough to a man who had lately left a warm
little room of nondescript furnishing but most homelike
atmosphere. To tell the truth, Black was feeling something
resembling a touch of homesickness which seemed
to centre in an old high-backed wooden rocking-chair
cushioned with &#8220;Turkey red.&#8221; He was wondering if he
might send for that homely old chair, and if he should, how
it would look among these dignified surroundings. He
didn&#8217;t care a picayune how it might look&mdash;he decided that
he simply had to have it if he stayed. Which proved that
it really was homesickness for his country parish which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
had attacked him that morning. Why not? Do you
think him less of a man for that?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yours&#8217;ll go quite a way!&#8221; young Tom Lockhart
assured him cheerfully. &#8220;And you can use the rest of the
space for magazines and papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221; replied Black, rather grimly grateful for
this comforting suggestion. He and the twenty-year-old
son of his hostess had become very good friends in the
two days which had elapsed since Black&#8217;s arrival. He had
an idea that Tom was going to be a distinct asset in the
days to come. The young man&#8217;s fair hair and blue eyes
were by no means indicative of softness&mdash;being counteracted
by a pugnacious snub nose, a chin so positive that it
might easily become a menace, and a grin which decidedly
suggested impishness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help unpack these, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom laid hold of the books with a will. Black, his coat
off, set them up, thereby indisputably demonstrating that
two hundred and thirty-one volumes, even though a round
two dozen of them be bulky with learning, certainly do
fill an inconceivably small space.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow,&#8221; he said, resting from his labours, and
determinedly turning away from the embarrassing testimony
of the bookshelves as to his resources, to the invitation
of the massive desk to be equipped with the proper
appliances to work, &#8220;a few pictures and things will help
to make it look as if somebody lived here. I&#8217;ve several
pretty good photographs and prints I thought I&#8217;d frame
when I got here&mdash;I&#8217;ve been saving them up for some
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He exhibited the collection with pride&mdash;they had lain
across the top of the books. Tom Lockhart hung over
them critically.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;re bully!&#8221; was his judgment. &#8220;Not a bit
what I&#8217;d have expected. Not a saint or a harp among
&#8217;em. Oh, gee!&mdash;that horse race is great! Where&#8217;d you
get that? I mean&mdash;it&#8217;s foreign, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s just a bit of a hurdle race we
had in a little town down South. I&#8217;m on one of those
horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are! Oh, yes&mdash;I see&mdash;on the front one! Why,
say&mdash;&#8221; he turned to Black, enthusiasm lighting his face&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;re
one of those regular horse-riding Southerners.
This is on your family estate, I&#8217;ll wager.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black&#8217;s face flushed a little, but his eyes met the boy&#8217;s
frankly. &#8220;I was born in Scotland, and came over here
when I was sixteen. I worked for the man who lived in
that house back there at the left. He let me ride his
horses. I broke the black one for him&mdash;and rode him to a
finish in that race. I was only seventeen then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom stared for a minute before his manners came
to the rescue. &#8220;That&#8217;s awfully interesting,&#8221; he said then,
politely. Black could see the confusion and wonderment
in his mind as plainly as if the boy had given expression
to it. If the information had let Tom down a little,
the next instant he rallied to the recognition that here was
a man out of the ordinary. Tom was not a snob, but he
had never before heard a minister own to &#8220;working&#8221; for
anybody, and it had startled him slightly. But when he
regarded Black, he saw a man who, while he looked as if
he had never worked for anybody, had not hesitated to
declare that he had. Tom thought he liked the combination.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could tell me of a good place to get these
framed,&#8221; Black said, gathering up the photographs and
prints as he spoke, &#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll have it done right away.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
It&#8217;s the one thing that&#8217;ll make this big house seem a little
more like home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. And I can tell you a peach of a place&mdash;in
fact I&#8217;ll take you there, if you want to go right now.
It&#8217;s on our way back home. By the way&mdash;&#8221; young
Tom glanced round the big bare room&mdash;&#8220;if there&#8217;s any
stuff you want to get for the house to give it a kind of a
jolly air, you know, you&#8217;ll find it right there, at Jane Ray&#8217;s.
She can advise you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ll get anything but the frames,&#8221;
Black answered cautiously, as the two went out together.
He had received an advance on his new salary, and therefore
he had more money in his pocket than he had ever had
before at one time, but he was too much in the habit of
needing to count every penny to think of starting out
to buy anything not strictly necessary. And already he
knew Tom for the usual careless spender, the rich man&#8217;s
son. Very likely, he thought, this place to which Tom was
to take him was the most expensive place in the suburban
town. On second thought, he decided to take along only
two of his pictures&mdash;till he knew the prices he must pay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It had not been a particularly busy morning for Jane
Ray. She was occupied with only one customer at the
moment when Robert Black and young Thomas Lockhart
came down the side street upon which fronted her shop&mdash;a
side street down which many feet were accustomed to
turn, in search of Jane and her wares.</p>

<p>The customer with whom she was occupied stood with
her at the rear of the shop before several specimens of
antique desks and chairs. All about were other pieces,
some of them proclaiming themselves rather rare. Jane
Ray herself also looked rather rare&mdash;for a shopkeeper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
inasmuch as she did not look like a shopkeeper at all,
though the chaste severity of her business attire rivalled
that of her latest acquired possession over which that
morning she was gloating&mdash;a genuine Adam mirror. This
mirror reflected faithfully Jane&#8217;s smooth, chestnut brown
head, her slightly dusky skin with an underlying tinge of
pink, her dark eyes which held a spice of mischief in spite
of their cool alertness of glance, her faintly aggressive
chin&mdash;which meant that she could argue with you about
the value of her goods and hold her own, and in the end
convince you, without making you unhappy about it&mdash;which
is a rare accomplishment, especially in so young a
woman as was Miss Ray.</p>

<p>Robert Black and Tom, the latter self-constituted guide
to furnishing a manse with what might be called its superfluous
necessities, entered the shop and stood waiting.
Jane saw them in her Adam mirror, but she continued to
discuss with her other customer the relative merits of a
Chippendale desk having all manner of hidden springs
and drawers in it, with those of a Sheraton pouch-table,
a work-table with a silken bag beneath it, and essentially
feminine in its appeal. The customer was making a present
to his wife, and had fled to Jane in this trying emergency&mdash;as
did many another man. Jane always knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this some place?&#8221; murmured young Lockhart,
proudly, hanging over a glass show-case on a cherry
gate-table. &#8220;Ever get into a woman&#8217;s shop that catered
to men like this one? Look at this case of pipes&mdash;aren&#8217;t
they stunners? She knows all there is to know about
every last thing she sells, and what&#8217;s more, she never keeps
anything but good stuff. Some of it&#8217;s pretty rare, and all
of it&#8217;s corking. Look at those cats&#8217; eyes!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Black had caught sight of certain headlines in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
New York daily lying beside the case of semi-precious
stones which had attracted Tom. It was a late morning
edition, and this suburban town lay too far from New
York for the later morning editions to reach it before early
afternoon&mdash;anyhow, they were not to be had at the news-stands
before two o&#8217;clock, as Black had discovered yesterday.
He seized the paper, wondering how this woman
shopkeeper had achieved the impossible. He was a voracious
reader of war-news, this Scotsman by blood and
American to the last loyal drop of it. But he was not satisfied
with America&#8217;s part in the great conflict. For this
was April, nineteen sixteen, and the thing had been going
on for almost two years.</p>

<p>He devoured the black headlines.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">&#8220;NO BREAK IN THE FRENCH LINES YET.<br />
SEVENTH WEEK OF THE STRUGGLE AT VERDUN<br />
TOTAL GAIN ONLY FOUR TO FIVE MILES<br />
ON A THIRTY-FIVE MILE FRONT.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>He flamed into low, swift speech, striking the paper
before him with his fist. Tom, listening, forgot to gaze
upon the contents of the case before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those French&mdash;aren&#8217;t they magnificent? Why
aren&#8217;t we there, fighting by their sides? Oh, we&#8217;ll get
there yet, but it&#8217;s hard to wait. Think of those fellows&mdash;holding
on two long, anxious years! And they came over
here&mdash;Lafayette and the rest&mdash;and poured out their blood
and their money for us. And we think we&#8217;re doing something
when we send them a little food and some tobacco
to buck up on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say&mdash;do you want to fight&mdash;a minister? Why, I
thought all your profession asked for was peace!&#8221; Young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Tom&#8217;s tone was curious. He did not soon forget the look
in the face of the man who answered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peace! We do want peace&mdash;but not peace without
honour! And no minister fit to preach preaches anything
like that! Don&#8217;t think it of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I used to hear Doctor Curtin&mdash;the man before
you. He seemed to think&mdash;&mdash; But I didn&#8217;t agree with
him,&#8221; Tom hastened to say, suddenly deciding it best not
to quote the pacific utterances of the former holder of the
priestly office. &#8220;I thought we ought to go to it. If this
country ever does get into it&mdash;though Dad thinks it&#8217;ll all be
settled this year&mdash;you bet I&#8217;ll enlist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enlist! I should say so!&#8221; And Black took up the
paper again, eagerly reading aloud the account which followed
the headlines of the sturdy holding of the fiercely
contested ground at Verdun&mdash;that name which will be remembered
while the world lasts.</p>

<p>He looked up at length to find that the other customer
had gone, and that Miss Ray, the shopkeeper, had come
forward. He looked into a face which reflected his own
pride in the French prowess, and forgot for the instant that
he had come to buy of her or that she was there to sell.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great, isn&#8217;t it&mdash;the way they are holding?&#8221; she
said, in a pleasant, low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great?&mdash;it&#8217;s glorious! By the way&mdash;how do you get
hold of this late edition so early?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it sent up by special messenger from the city.
Otherwise it would be held over with the rest of the papers
till the two o&#8217;clock train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom broke in. &#8220;Pretty clever of you, <i>I</i> say, Miss Ray.
Just like the rest of your business methods&mdash;always ahead
of the other fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Lockhart,&#8221; Miss Ray answered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do to let one&#8217;s methods become as antique
as one&#8217;s goods in this case, would it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ray, I want to present my friend, Mr. Black.&#8221;
Tom forgot his new friend&#8217;s title as he made this introduction,
but of course it didn&#8217;t matter. Though Miss
Ray seldom attended church anywhere, she could hardly
fail, in the talkative suburban town, to know that at
the &#8220;Stone Church&#8221; there was a new man. &#8220;He wants
to get some of his pictures framed, and of course I led
him here,&#8221; added Tom, with his boyish grin. He looked
at Miss Ray with his usual frankly admiring gaze. No
doubt but she was worth it. Not often does a woman
shopkeeper achieve the subtle effect of being a young
hostess in her own apartments as did Jane Ray. And, as
every woman shopkeeper knows, that is the highest, as
it is the most difficult, art of shopkeeping.</p>

<p>She scanned the pictures&mdash;one that of the hurdle race,
the other a view of a country road, with a white spired
church in the distance. In no time she had them fitted
into precisely the right frames, these enhancing their
values as well-chosen frames do. Delighted but still
cautious, Black inquired the prices. Miss Ray mentioned
them, adding the phrase with which he was familiar, &#8220;with
the clerical discount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; acknowledged Black. &#8220;What are they
without the discount, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Ray glanced at him. &#8220;I am accustomed to give
it,&#8221; she observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am accustomed not to take it,&#8221; said the Scotsman,
firmly. &#8220;But I&#8217;m just as much obliged.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, and told him the regular price. He counted
this out, expressed his pleasure in having found precisely
what he wanted, and led the way out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>Jane Ray looked after his well-set shoulders, noting
that he did not put his hat upon his close-cut, inclined-to-be-wirily-curly
black hair until he had reached the street.
Then she looked down at the money in her hand.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t take a discount&mdash;and didn&#8217;t ask me to come
to his church,&#8221; she commented to herself. &#8220;Must be
rather a new sort.&#8221; She then promptly dismissed him
from her thoughts&mdash;until later in the day, when the memory
was brought back to her by another incident.</p>

<p>It was well along in the afternoon, and she had just
sold a genuine Eli Terry &#8220;grandfather&#8221; clock at a fair
profit, and had bargained for and secured several very
beautiful pieces of Waterford glass which she had long
coveted. A succession of heavy showers had cleared her
shop, and she had found time to open a long roll which the
expressman had delivered in the morning, when the shop
door admitted a person to whom she turned an eager
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s you!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Come and see
what I have <i>now</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; replied R. P. Burns, M.D., with,
however, a smile which belied his words. &#8220;I want a
present for a sick baby I&#8217;m going to fix up in the morning.
One of those painted Russian things of yours&mdash;the last
boy went crazy over &#8217;em. No time for antiques.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t an antique&mdash;it&#8217;s the last word from the
front, and <i>you&#8217;ll</i> go crazy over <i>it</i>,&#8221; replied Miss Ray.
Nevertheless she left the roll and went to a corner in the
back of the shop given over to all sorts of foreign made and
fascinating wooden toys. She selected a bear with a
wide smile and feet which walked, and a gay-hued parrot
on a stick, and took them to the big man who was waiting,
like Mercury, poised on an impatient foot. While he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
counted out the change she slipped over to her roll of
heavy papers, took out one, and when he looked up again
it was straight into a great French war poster held at
the length of Jane&#8217;s extended arms. He stared hard at it,
and well he might, for it was by one of the most famous
of French artists, whose imagination had been flaming
with the vision of the desperate day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, by Joe!&#8221; Burns ejaculated, his hurry forgot.
&#8220;I say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The poster&#8217;s owner waited quietly, lost to view behind
the big sheet. Burns studied every detail of the picture,
losing no suggestion indicated by the clever lines of the
inspired pencil. It was only a rough sketch, impressionistic
to the last degree, yet holding unspoken volumes in
each bold outline. Then he drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221; he asked, as Jane lowered the
poster. His eye went back to the roll lying half opened on
a mahogany table near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were sent over by an officer I know&mdash;straight
from Paris. That isn&#8217;t the most wonderful one by half,
but I want you to see the rest when you&#8217;re not so rushed
for time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not particularly rushed,&#8221; replied Burns, with a
grin. &#8220;At least, I can stop if you&#8217;ve any more like this.
I have to tear in and out of your place, you know, because
there&#8217;s always some idiot lurking behind one of your
screens to leap out and ask me searching questions about
patients. If you&#8217;ll bar your doors to the public some day,
I&#8217;ll come and spend an hour gazing at your stuff. Let&#8217;s
see the posters, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane spread them out, one after another, till half the
shop was covered. Burns walked from poster to poster,
intent, frowning with interest, his quick intelligence recognizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the extraordinary impressions he was getting, his
own imagination firing under the stimulus of an art at its
marvellous best. Before one of the smaller posters he
lingered longest&mdash;a wash drawing in colour of a poilu
holding his child in his arms, with its mother looking into
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just a kid, that fellow,&#8221; he said, in a smothered
tone, &#8220;just a kid, but he&#8217;s giving &#8217;em both up. He won&#8217;t
come back&mdash;somehow you know that. And&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t
seem to matter, if he helps save his country. See here&mdash;you
ought to do something with these. If the people of
this town could see them, a few more of them might wake
up to the idea that there&#8217;s a war on somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as some English ones come I&#8217;ve sent for I
intend to have an exhibition, here in my shop, and sell
them&mdash;for the benefit of French and Belgian orphans. I
expect to get all kinds of prices. Will you auction them
off for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I will&mdash;if I can do it explosively enough. I&#8217;d
do anything on earth for a little chap like that.&#8221; He indicated
a wistful Belgian baby at the edge of a group of
children. &#8220;Here are our youngsters, fed up within an
inch of their lives, and these poor little duffers living on
scraps, and too few of those. Oh, what a contrast! As
for ourselves&mdash;we come around and buy antiques to make
our homes more stunning!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked her in the eye, and she looked steadily back.
Then she went over to an impressive Georgian desk,
opened a drawer and took out a black-bound book. Returning,
she silently held it out to him. It was a text book
on nursing, one of those required in a regulation hospital
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? What?&#8221; he ejaculated, taking the book. &#8220;Studying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
are you&mdash;all by yourself? How far are you?&#8221; He
flipped the pages. &#8220;I see. Are you serious?&mdash;You, a
successful business woman? What do you want to do it
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely serious. This country will go into the
war some day&mdash;it must, or I can&#8217;t respect it any more.
And when it does&mdash;well, keeping an antique shop will be
the deadest thing there is. I&#8217;ll nail up the door and go
&#8216;over there.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And not to collect curios this time?&#8221; His bright
hazel eyes were studying her intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly. To be of use, if I can. I thought the more
I knew of nursing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get very far alone, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can get far enough so that when I do manage to take
a course I can rush it&mdash;can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know&mdash;hard to cut any red tape. But all
preparation counts, of course. Well&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you a question
to answer that&#8217;ll show up what you do know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He proceeded to do this, considering for a minute, and
then firing at her not one but a series of interrogations.
These were not unkindly technical, but designed to test
her practical knowledge of the pages&mdash;which according to
the marker he had found&mdash;she had evidently lately finished.
The answers she gave him appeared to satisfy him,
though he did not say so. Instead, closing the book with
a snap, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When you sail my wife and I will be on the same ship.
We&#8217;d be there now if we had our way&mdash;it&#8217;s all we talk
about. Well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And he was about to say that he must hurry like mad
now to make up for time well lost, when the shop door
opened to admit out of a sharp dash of rain a customer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
who was trying to shelter a flat package beneath his coat.
For the second time that day Robert Black was bringing
pictures to be framed; in fact, they were the rest of the pile
which he had not ventured to bring the first time, lest Miss
Ray&#8217;s prices be too high for him.</p>

<p>Red gave him one look, and would have fled, but Black
did not make for the big doctor with outstretched hand&mdash;in
fact, he did not seem to see him. At the very front of
the shop stood a particularly distinguished looking Hepplewhite
sideboard, its serpentine front exquisitely inlaid
with satinwood, its location one to catch the eye. It
caught Black&#8217;s eye&mdash;but not because of any cunning
design of maker or shopkeeper. Having filled the available
space in the rear of the shop with her war posters,
Jane had worked toward the front, and the last and most
splendid of them she had propped upon the sideboard.
In front of it Black now came to a standstill, and Red,
intending to leave the place in haste at sight of the minister
he was in no hurry to meet, involuntarily paused
to note the effect upon the &#8220;Kid&#8221;&mdash;as he persisted in
calling him&mdash;of the poster&#8217;s touchingly convincing appeal.</p>

<p>It was a drawing in black and white of a French mother
taking leave of her son, that subject which has employed
so many clever pens and brushes since the war began, but
than which there is none more universally powerful in its
importunity. The indomitable courage in the face of the
Frenchwoman had in it a touch beyond that of the ordinary
artist to convey&mdash;one could not analyze it, but it
gripped the heart none the less, as Red himself could testify.
He now watched it grip Black.</p>

<p>Without taking his eyes from the picture Black propped
his umbrella against a chair, laid his hat and his package
upon it, and stood still before the Frenchwoman and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
boy, unconscious of anything else. And as he stood there,
slowly his hands, hanging at his sides, became fists which
clenched themselves. Red, observing, his own hand upon
the big wrought-iron latch of the door, paused still a moment
longer. The &#8220;Kid&#8221; cared, did he? How much did
he care, then? Red found himself rather wanting to know.</p>

<p>Black looked up at last, saw the other man, saw that he
was the quarry he was so anxious to run down, but only
said, as his gaze returned to the poster, &#8220;And she&#8217;s
only one of thousands, all with a spirit like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only one,&#8221; Red agreed. &#8220;They&#8217;re astonishing, those
Frenchwomen.&#8221; Then he went on out and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>After he had gone he admitted to himself that since his
wife was a member of this man&#8217;s church, and Black probably
knew that fact, he himself might have stayed long
enough to shake hands. At close range his eyesight,
trained to observe, had not been able to avoid noting that
Black was no boy, after all. There had been that in the
face he had momentarily turned toward Red to show
plainly that he was in the full first maturity of manhood.
It may be significant that from this moment, in whatever
terms Red spoke of the minister at home when he was
forced by the exigencies of conversation to mention him at
all, he ceased to call him &#8220;the Kid.&#8221; So, though Black
did not know it, he had passed at least one barrier to getting
to know the man he meant to make his friend.</p>

<small>NO AN&AElig;STHETIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OF COURSE the day came, as it inevitably must, when
Black and Red actually met, face to face, with no
way out but to shake hands, look each other in the eye,
and consider their acquaintance made? No, that day of
proper introduction never came. But the day did come
on which they looked each other in the eye without shaking
hands&mdash;and another day, a long time after, they did
shake hands. As to their friendship&mdash;but that&#8217;s what
this story is about.</p>

<p>The day on which they looked each other in the eye
first was on a Sunday morning, rather early. Black had
done a perfectly foolhardy thing. It was a late June
day, and the cherries in a certain tree just outside his
bathroom window were blood-red ripe and tempting.
Fresh from his cold tub&mdash;clad in shirt and trousers, unshaven&mdash;his
mouth watering at the thought of eating
cherries before breakfast, he climbed out of the window
upon the sloping roof of the side porch, and let himself
down to the edge to reach the cherries. He never knew
how the fool thing happened, really; the only thing he did
know was that he slipped suddenly upon the edge of the
roof, wet with an early morning shower, and fell heavily
to the ground below, striking on his right shoulder. And
then, presently, he was sitting at the telephone in his
study, addressing R. P. Burns, M.D., in terms which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
strove to be casual, inviting him to make a morning call
at the manse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d come over myself,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;but I&#8217;m
ashamed to say I&#8217;m a trifle shaky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; replied the crisp voice at the other end of
the wire. &#8220;Go and lie down till I get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please have your breakfast first,&#8221; requested Black,
struggling hard to master a growing faintness. Whatever
he had done to his shoulder, it hurt rather badly, though
he didn&#8217;t mind that so much as the idea of disgracing himself
in Burns&#8217; eyes by going white and flabby over what
was probably a trivial injury. To be sure he couldn&#8217;t
use his arm, but it didn&#8217;t occur to him that he had actually
dislocated that shoulder by so trifling a means as a slip
from the manse roof. The manse roof, of all places! It
wasn&#8217;t built for incumbent ministers to go upon, between
a bath and a shave, and tumble from like a little boy&mdash;and
on a Sunday morning, too!</p>

<p>The answer Red gave to Black&#8217;s suggestion that he
have breakfast before coming resembled a grunt more than
anything else. Black couldn&#8217;t determine whether the red-headed
doctor meant to do it or not. The question was
settled within five minutes by the arrival of Red, who
came straight in at the open manse door, followed the call
Black gave, &#8220;In here, please&mdash;at your left,&#8221; and appeared
in the study doorway, surgical bag in his hand, and a somewhat
grim expression&mdash;with which Black had already become
familiar at a distance&mdash;upon his lips. Black sat in
his red-cushioned wooden rocker, that most incongruous
piece of furniture in the midst of the black walnut dignity
of the manse study, and in it his appearance suggested
that of a sick boy who has taken refuge in his mother&#8217;s
arms. Indeed, it may have been with somewhat of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
feeling that he had chosen it as the place in which to wait
the coming of aid. Anyhow, his face, under its unshaven
blur of beard, looked rather white, though his voice was
steady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty sorry to bother you at this hour, Doctor
Burns,&#8221; he began, but was interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you to lie down? What&#8217;s the use of
sitting up and getting faint?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see! All alone here? Thought you had a
housekeeper.&#8221; Red was opening up his bag and laying
out supplies as he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have. She&#8217;s gone home for over Sunday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They usually have&mdash;when anything happens. Well,
come over here on this couch, if you can walk, and we&#8217;ll
see what the trouble is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black demonstrated that he could walk, though it
was with considerable effort. Through all his undeniable
faintness he was thinking with some exultation that this
was a perfectly good chance to meet Red&mdash;and on his own
ground, too. What luck!</p>

<p>Red made a brief examination.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve fixed that shoulder, all right,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;No matter&mdash;we&#8217;ll have you under a whiff of ether, and
reduce it in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks&mdash;no ether, please. You mean I&#8217;ve dislocated
it?&#8221; inquired the patient, speaking with some difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good and proper. Here you are&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And without
loss of time a peculiarly shaped article, made of wire and
gauze and smelling abominably, came over Black&#8217;s face.
It was instantly removed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I said no ether, if you please!&#8221; remarked an
extraordinarily obstinate voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;Nonsense, man! I&#8217;m only going to give you enough
to relax you. I see some good stiff muscles there that
may give me trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ether&#8217;ll make me sick, and I&#8217;ve got to preach this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Preach&mdash;nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be nothing,&#8221; agreed the patient, &#8220;but I&#8217;m
going to preach it, just the same. And I won&#8217;t have an
an&aelig;sthetic, thank you just as much, Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red said no more. No surgeon but is astute enough
to tell whether a patient is bluffing or whether he means it.
Unquestionably, though Black&#8217;s face was the colour of
ashes, he meant it. Therefore Red proceeded to reduce the
dislocation, without the advantage to himself&mdash;or to the
patient&mdash;of the relaxing aid of the an&aelig;sthetic. It was a
bad dislocation, and it took the doctor&#8217;s own sturdy muscles
and all his professional skill to do the trick in a few
quick, efficient moves and one tremendous pull. But it was
all over in less time that it takes to tell it, and only one low
groan had escaped Black&#8217;s tightly pressed lips. Nevertheless
his forehead was wet and cold when he lay limp
at the end of that bad sixty seconds.</p>

<p>A strong arm came under his shoulders, and a glass was
held to his lips. &#8220;Drink this&mdash;you&#8217;ll be all right in a
minute,&#8221; said a rather far-away voice, and Black obediently
swallowed something which he didn&#8217;t much like&mdash;and
which he probably would have refused to take if he
had suspected that it was going to help buck him up the
way it did. He had an absurd idea of not allowing himself
to be bucked up by anything but his own will&mdash;not in the
presence of Red, anyhow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some nerve&mdash;for a preacher,&#8221; presently said the voice
which sounded nearer now.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>&#8220;Why&mdash;a preacher?&#8221; inquired Black, as belligerently
as a man can who is stretched upon his back with his coat
off, his arm being bandaged to his side, and a twenty-four
hours&#8217; growth of beard on his somewhat aggressive chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; Red commanded. &#8220;We won&#8217;t have it
out now. I don&#8217;t blame you&mdash;that was hitting a man
when he&#8217;s down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not down.&#8221; Black attempted to sit up. A
vigorous arm detained him where he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just keep quiet a few minutes, and you&#8217;ll be the gainer
in the end. By the way&mdash;can you shave with your left
hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never tried it.&#8221; Black&#8217;s left hand took account of
his cheek and chin. &#8220;I was just going to shave when
those&mdash;fool&mdash;cherries caught my eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your shaving stuff?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black looked up, startled. &#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t let you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to do it? If you must preach, you don&#8217;t
want to go to it looking like a pugilist, do you? Though
I&#8217;m not so sure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Red left the sentence unfinished,
while a wicked smile played round his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it myself&mdash;or send for a barber.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come on, Black! I&#8217;m perfectly competent to do
the job, and now I&#8217;ve got my hand in on you I&#8217;d like to
leave you looking the part you wouldn&#8217;t insist on playing
if you weren&#8217;t pretty game. I&#8217;m not so sure I ought to
let you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see you help it,&#8221; declared Black, and now he
was smiling, too, and feeling distinctly better.</p>

<p>So it ended by Red&#8217;s going upstairs after the shaving
materials, and then shaving Black, and doing it with
decidedly less finish of style than might have been expected
of a crack surgeon with a large reputation. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
cut his victim once, and Black, putting up a hand and
getting it all blood and lather, grinned up into Red&#8217;s face,
who grinned back and expressed his regret at the slip.
This does not mean that they had become friends&mdash;not
from Red&#8217;s standpoint, at least, who would have befriended
a sick dog and then shot him without compunction
because he didn&#8217;t want him around. But it does
mean that at last the two had met, on a man-to-man basis,
and that Red&#8217;s respect for the man he had been in no
hurry to meet had been considerably augmented. Black
was pretty sure of this, and it helped to brace him more
than the stimulant had done.</p>

<p>Two hours later Red cut a call on a rich patient much
shorter than was politic, in order to get to the Stone
Church in time to slip into a back pew. Before going in
he gave young Perkins instructions not to call him out
before the sermon ended for anything short of murder
on the church doorstep, surprising that lively usher very
much, since it was the first time such a thing had ever
happened. In making this effort Red had Black in mind
as a patient rather than a minister. A severe dislocation
must naturally cause a certain amount of nervous shock
which might prove disastrous to a man attempting to
carry through a long service and spend most of the period
upon his feet, within two hours after the accident occurred.
Game though Black might be&mdash;well&mdash;Red admitted to
himself that he rather wanted to see how the fellow whom
he could no longer call &#8220;the Kid&#8221; would see the thing
through.</p>

<p>Reactions are curious things. In this case, though it
was true that Black had to steady himself more than once
to keep his congregation from whirling dizzily and disconcertingly
before his eyes, had to set his teeth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
summon every ounce of will he possessed to keep on
through the first three quarters of his service, after all it
was Red who got the most of the reaction. For the sermon
which Black preached contained a bomb thrown
straight at the heads of a parish which, with half the world
at war, was in its majority distinctly pacifist&mdash;as was
many another church during the year of 1916. Black,
before his sermon was done, had taken an out-and-out,
unflinching stand for the place of the Church in times of
war, and had declared that it must be on the side of the
sword, when the sword was the only weapon which could
thrust its way to peace.</p>

<p>Red, listening closely, forgetting that the man before
him was his patient, found himself involuntarily admitting
that whatever else he was, Robert McPherson Black was
fearless in his speech. And there was probably no use in
denying that the fellow had a way of putting things that,
as James Macauley had asserted, effectually prevented the
man in the pew from becoming absorbed in reveries of his
own. It had been by no means unusual for R. P. Burns,
surgeon, expecting to do a critical operation on Monday
morning, to perform that operation in detail on Sunday
morning, while sitting with folded arms and intent expression
before a man who was endeavouring to interest
him in spiritual affairs. On the present occasion, however,
though the coming Monday&#8217;s clinical schedule was full to
the hatches, Red was unable to detach himself for a moment
from the subject being handled so vigorously by
Black. Thus, listening through to the closing words, he
discovered himself to be aflame with fires which another
hand had kindled, and that hand, most marvellously, a
preacher&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Young Perkins, hovering close to the rear seat into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
which Red had stolen upon coming in just before the sermon,
considered the embargo raised with the closing
words of Black, and had his whispered summons ready
precisely as Black began his brief closing prayer. The
scowl with which Red motioned him away surprised Perkins
very much, causing him to retreat to the outer door,
where in due season he delivered his message to the leisurely
departing doctor&mdash;departing leisurely because he
was eavesdropping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; he had overheard one
man of prominence saying to another in the vestibule.
&#8220;Strikes me that&#8217;s going pretty strong. What&#8217;s the use
of stirring up trouble? That sort of talk&#8217;s going to offend.
Pulpit&#8217;s not called upon to go into matters of state&mdash;particularly
now, when public sentiment&#8217;s so divided.
Somebody better put a flea in his ear, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other man nodded. &#8220;I believe a good deal as he
does myself,&#8221; he admitted, cautiously, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t hold
with offending people who have as good a right to their
opinions as he has. I saw Johnstone wriggling more than
once, toward the last&mdash;and he&#8217;s about the last man we
want to make mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>R. P. Burns laid a heavy hand on the speaker&#8217;s arm.
Turning, the other man looked into a pair of contemptuous
hazel eyes, with whose glance, both friendly and fiery,
he had been long familiar. &#8220;Oh, <i>rot</i>!&#8221; said a low voice in
his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that. Think it out.&#8221; And Burns was gone, in
the press, with the quickness now of one accustomed to
get where he would go, no matter how many were in the
way.</p>

<p>He marched around to the vestry door, where he found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Black standing, his gown off, his face gone rather white,
though it had been full of colour when Red saw it last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faint?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;thanks, I&#8217;m all right. Just thought I&#8217;d like a
whiff of fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a few deep breaths. I&#8217;ll give you a pick-up, if
you say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoulder ache?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. I&#8217;m all right, I tell you, Doctor. Can&#8217;t
you get over the idea that a preacher is a man of straw?
Why, I&mdash;will you try a wrestle with me, sometime&mdash;when
my shoulder&#8217;s fit again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Red laughed. &#8220;Down you in two minutes and fifteen
seconds,&#8221; he prophesied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try it, and see.&#8221; And Black walked back into the
church, his cheek losing its pallor in a hurry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On that Sunday the Lockharts, his first entertainers,
insisted that he come to dinner. Though he had kept
his slung shoulder and arm under his gown, the facts
showed plainly, and the congregation was full of sympathy.
With his housekeeper away, Black could find no
way out, though he would have much preferred remaining
quietly in his study, with four cups of coffee of his own
amateur making, and whatever he could find in his larder
left over from Saturday.</p>

<p>So he went to the Lockharts&#8217;, and there he met a person
who had been in his congregation that morning, but whom
he had not noted. She had seen that he had not noted
her, but she had made up her mind that such blindness
should not long continue. Her appearance was one well
calculated to arrest the eye of man, and Black&#8217;s eye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
though it was accustomed to dwell longer upon man than
upon woman, was not one calculated by Nature to be
altogether and indefinitely undiscerning.</p>

<p>With Annette Lockhart, daughter of the house, the
guest, Miss Frances Fitch, a former school friend, held a
brief consultation just before Black&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think he&#8217;s the sort to fall for chaste severity, or feminine
frivolity, when it comes to dress, Nanny?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Lockhart looked her friend over. &#8220;You&#8217;re just
the same old plotter, aren&#8217;t you, Fanny Fitch?&#8221; she observed,
frankly. &#8220;Well, it will take all you can do, and
then some, if you expect to interest Mr. Black. But&mdash;if
you want my advice&mdash;I should say chaste severity was
your line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where you show your unintelligence,&#8221; declared
Miss Fitch. &#8220;I shall be as frilly as I can, because
you yourself are a model of smooth and tailored fitness,
and he will want a relief for his eyes. He shall find it in
me. Really, wasn&#8217;t he awfully game to preach, with that
shoulder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a Scot,&#8221; said Nan Lockhart. &#8220;Of course he
would, if it killed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The result of this exchange of views was that Miss Fitch
appeared looking like a fascinating young saint in a sheer
white frock. Had she a white heart? Well, anyhow, she
looked the embodiment of ingenuousness, for her masses
of fair hair were too curly to be entirely subdued, no
matter how confined, and her deep blue eyes beneath
the blonde locks might have been those of a beautiful
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say!&#8221; ejaculated Tom Lockhart, when she first
came downstairs, the transformation from her dark
smoothness of church garb to this spring-like outburst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
whiteness hitting him full in his vulnerable young heart&mdash;as
usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;like me, Tommy dear?&#8221; asked Fanny Fitch,
letting her fingers rest for the fraction of a second on his
dark-blue coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like you!&#8221; breathed Tom. &#8220;I say&mdash;why did I bring
him home to dinner? Now you&#8217;ll just fascinate him&mdash;and
forget me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget <i>you</i>? Why, Tom!&#8221; And Miss Fitch gave him
an enchanting glance which made his heart turn over.
Then she went on into the big living room, where Robert
McPherson Black, damaged shoulder and arm in a fine black
silk sling, the colour now wholly restored to his interesting
face, rose courteously to be presented to her. Of course
he did not know it, but it was at that moment that he
encountered a quite remarkable combination of the world,
the flesh, and the devil. Up to now he had met each of
these tremendous forces separately, but never before all
together in one slim girl&#8217;s form. And yet, right here, it
must be definitely asserted and thoroughly assimilated,
that Fanny Fitch was what is known as an entirely
&#8220;nice&#8221; girl, and in her heart at that hour was nothing which
could be called an evil intent. The worst that could be
said of her was that she was ruthless in exacting tribute&mdash;even
as C&aelig;sar. And when her eye had fallen upon the
minister, with his right arm out of commission but the rest
of him exceedingly assertive of power, she had coveted
him. To her, the rest seemed easy.</p>

<p>As to Black&mdash;he was not &#8220;easy.&#8221; In his very young manhood
he had loved very much the pretty daughter of his
Southern employer, but she had been as far out of his
reach as the furthermost star in the bright constellations
which nightly met his eye in the skies above him. When she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
had married he had firmly and definitely put the thought
of woman out of his head, and had formulated a code concerning
the whole sex intended to hold throughout his
ministry. During his entire first pastorate he had been a
model of discretion&mdash;as a young minister in a country
community must be, if he would not have his plans for service
tumbling about his ears. Fortunately for him he
was, by temperament and by training, not over susceptible
to any ordinary feminine environment or approach. He
had a hearty and wholesome liking for the comradeship of
men, greatly preferring it to the frequent and unavoidable
association with women necessary in the workings of
church affairs. Even when his eye first rested upon the
really enchanting beauty of Miss Fanny Fitch, if he
could have exchanged her, as his companion at the Lockhart
dinner table, for R. P. Burns, M.D., he would have
done it in the twinkling of an eye. For had not Red
shaved him that morning, and wasn&#8217;t another barrier most
probably well down? It was of that he was thinking, and
not, just then, of her.</p>

<p>But she forced him to think of her&mdash;it was an art in
which she was a finished performer. She did it by cutting
up for him that portion of a crown roast of spring lamb
which Mr. Samuel Lockhart sent to him upon his plate.
Up to that moment, throughout the earlier courses, he
had been engaged with the rest in a general discussion of
the subject of the war, quite naturally brought up by the
sermon of the morning. But when it came to regarding
helplessly the food which now appeared before him unmanageable
by either fork or spoon, he found himself
for the first time talking with Miss Fitch alone, while the
conversation of the others went ahead upon a new tack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but this makes me think of how many poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
fellows have to have their food cut up for them, over
there,&#8221; she was saying, as her pretty, ringless fingers
expertly prepared the tender meat for his consumption.
&#8220;While you were speaking this morning I was wishing, as
I&#8217;ve been wishing ever since this terrible war began, that
I could be really helping, on the other side. If it hadn&#8217;t
been for my mother, who is quite an invalid, I should have
gone long ago. You made it all so <i>real</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A man may tell himself that he doesn&#8217;t like flattery,
but if it is cleverly administered&mdash;and if, though he is
modest enough, he can&#8217;t help knowing himself that he has
done a good thing in a fine way&mdash;how can he quite help
being human enough to feel a glow of pleasure? If it&#8217;s
not overdone&mdash;and Miss Fitch knew much better than
that&mdash;much can thus be accomplished in breaking down
a masculine wall of reserve. Black&#8217;s wall didn&#8217;t break
that Sunday&mdash;oh, not at all&mdash;but it undeniably did crumble
a little bit along the upper edges.</p>

<p>After dinner was over, however, as if he were somehow
subtly aware that the wall was undergoing an attack,
Black withdrew with the other men to the further end of
the living room to continue to talk things over. He was
at some pains to seat himself so that he was facing these
men, and had no view down the long room to the other
end, where the women were gathered.</p>

<p>Miss Fitch, looking his way from a corner of a great
divan, sent a smile and a wave toward Tom, who, torn
between allegiance to Fanny and his new and absorbing
devotion to Black, had for the time being followed the
men. Then she said negligently to Nan Lockhart:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your minister certainly has a stunning profile. Look
at it there against that dark-blue curtain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan looked for an instant, then back at her guest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
&#8220;Oh, Fanny!&#8221; she murmured, rebukingly, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
ever get tired of that game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What game, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;playing for every last one of them!&#8221; answered
Annette Lockhart, with some impatience. She was a
dark-eyed young woman with what might be called a
strong face, by no means unattractive in its clean-cut
lines. She had a personality all her own; she had been a
leader always; people liked Nan Lockhart, and believed
in her thoroughly. Her friendship for Fanny Fitch was a
matter of old college ties&mdash;Fanny was nobody&#8217;s fool, and
she was clever enough to keep a certain hold upon Nan
through the exercise of a rather remarkable dramatic
talent. Nan had written plays, and Fanny had acted
them; and now that college days were over they had
plans for the future which meant a continued partnership
in the specialty of each.</p>

<p>&#8220;Interested in him yourself, I judge,&#8221; Miss Fitch replied
teasingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry! The chances are all with
you. He&#8217;s horribly sober minded&mdash;he&#8217;ll fall for your sort
sooner than for mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But a certain gleam in her eyes said something else&mdash;that
she was quite satisfied with the beginning she had
made. Another man might have taken a seat where he
could look at her; that Black deliberately looked the
other way this astute young person considered proof
positive that he found her unexpectedly distracting to
his thoughts.</p>

<p>When, at the end of an hour, Black turned around, ready
to take his farewell, Miss Fitch was absent from the room.
He glanced about for her, found her not, told himself that
he was glad, and went out. As the door of the living
room closed behind him, she came down the stairs, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
white hat on her head, a white parasol in her hand.
They passed out of the house door together. At the street
Miss Fitch turned in the direction of the manse, two
blocks away. Black paused and removed his hat&mdash;with
his left hand he did it rather awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been very pleasant to meet you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is
your stay to be long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Several weeks, I believe. Are you really going that
way, Mr. Black&mdash;or don&#8217;t you venture to walk down the
street with any members of your congregation except
men?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled. &#8220;I am really going this way, Miss Fitch&mdash;thank
you! Would you care to know where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Doctor Burns&mdash;with your arm, I suppose. Is it
very painful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s doing very well. Isn&#8217;t this a magnificent day? I
hope you&#8217;ll have a pleasant walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly help it, thank you&mdash;I&#8217;m so fond of walking&mdash;which
Nan Lockhart isn&#8217;t&mdash;hard luck for me!
Good-bye&mdash;and I shall not soon forget what I heard this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her parting smile was one to remember&mdash;not a bit of
pique that he hadn&#8217;t responded to her obvious invitation&mdash;no
coquetry in it either, just charming friendliness, exceedingly
disarming. As he turned away, striding off in
the opposite direction from that which he naturally would
have taken, he was frowning a little and saying to himself
that it was going to be rather more difficult to keep the
old guard up in a place like this than it had been in his
country parish. His good Scottish conscience told him
that though in deciding on the instant to make Doctor
Burns a visit he had committed himself to something he
didn&#8217;t want to do at all&mdash;go and bother the difficult doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
with his shoulder when it wasn&#8217;t necessary&mdash;he must do
it now just the same, to square the thing. Heavens and
earth&mdash;why shouldn&#8217;t he walk down the street with a
beautiful young woman in white if she happened to be
going his way, instead of putting himself out to go where
he hated to, just to avoid her? Not that he cared to walk
with her&mdash;he didn&#8217;t&mdash;he preferred not to. And the doctor
would think him a weakling, after all, if he came to him
complaining, as was the truth, that his shoulder was aching
abominably, and his head to match, and that his pulse
seemed to be jumping along unpleasantly. Well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Just then R. P. Burns went by in his car at a terrific and
wholly inexcusable speed, evidently rushing out of town.
Black, recognizing him, breathed a sigh of relief. But he
went around seven blocks to get back to the Manse without
a chance of meeting anybody in white. At a very distant
sight of anybody clothed all in white he turned up the
first street, and this naturally lengthened his trip. So
that when he was finally within the Manse&#8217;s sheltering
walls he was very glad to give up bluffing for the day, and
to stretch himself upon the leather couch in the study where
that morning he had doggedly refused an an&aelig;sthetic.
He rather wished he had one now! Confound it&mdash;he felt
that he had been a fool more than once that day. Why
should ministers have to act differently from other men,
in any situation whatever? He made up his mind that
the next time he climbed out on a slippery roof on a Sunday
morning&mdash;well, he would do it if he wanted to! But the
next time he turned up a side street to avoid anybody&mdash;or
changed his direction because anybody was going the
same way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>When he woke an hour later it was because his shoulder
really was extremely sore and painful. But he wouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
have called Burns if he had known that that skillful surgeon
could take away every last twinge. Anyhow&mdash;Burns
had shaved him that morning! There was that that
was good to remember about the day. Sometime&mdash;he
would come closer to the red-headed doctor than that!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>NOBODY TO SAY A PRAYER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. HODDER, housekeeper at the manse, breathed
a heavy sigh as she poured the minister&#8217;s breakfast
coffee. He looked up, as she had known he would; his
ear seemed to be sensitive to sighs.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer, how things go for some people,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t get over feeling that a body should have Christian
burial, no matter what the circumstances is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about it,&#8221; said Black promptly. Mrs. Hodder
was not a talker&mdash;he did not think she was a gossip. She
had been selected for him by his good friend Mrs. Lockhart,
who had had in mind the necessity of finding the minister
a housekeeper built on these desirable lines. Mrs. Hodder
came as near such lines as seemed humanly possible,
though she had her faults. So had the minister, as he was
accustomed to remind himself, whenever he discovered
a new one in his housekeeper.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Hodder told him, and as he listened a peculiar
frown appeared between his eyebrows. The thing she
told him was of the sort to touch him to the quick. The
moment he had finished his breakfast&mdash;which he did in a
hurry&mdash;he went into the study, closed the door, and called
up a certain undertaker, whom&mdash;as is the case with the
men of Black&#8217;s profession&mdash;he had come to know almost
before he knew the leading men of his church.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nothing that need interest you, Mr. Black,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
replied the man of gloomy affairs, in the cheerful tone he
employed out of working hours. &#8220;It&#8217;s out in a community
where there isn&#8217;t any church&mdash;folks are dead against the
church, at that. Nobody expects any service&mdash;there won&#8217;t
be but a handful there, anyhow. There&#8217;s only the girl&#8217;s
grandmother for relatives&mdash;and the thing&#8217;s best kept
quiet. See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. What time are you to leave the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten o&#8217;clock. But you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be any actual objection to my coming,
would there, Mr. Munson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I suppose not. They simply don&#8217;t expect it&mdash;not
used to it. And in this case&mdash;if you understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do understand&mdash;and I very much want to come.
The trolley runs within two miles, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes. But I can send for you, if you insist&mdash;only&mdash;you
know they&#8217;re poor as poverty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want the walk, and I&#8217;ll catch the trolley&mdash;thank you.
If I should be a bit late&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll hold the thing for you&mdash;and&mdash;well, it&#8217;s certainly
very good of you, Mr. Black. I admit I like to see
such things done right myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation ended here, and Black ran for his
trolley, with only time to snatch a small, well-worn black
leather handbook from his desk. He had no time for a
change of clothes&mdash;which he wouldn&#8217;t have made in any
case, though he was not accustomed to dress in clerical
style upon the street, except in so far as a dark plainness
of attire might suggest his profession rather than emphasize
it.</p>

<p>He had two minutes to spare on a street corner, waiting
for his car. On that corner was a florist&#8217;s shop. Catching
sight of a window full of splendid roses he rushed in, gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
an order which made the girl in charge work fast, and
managed to speed up the whole transaction so successfully
that when he swung on to the moving step he had a slim
box under his arm. Only a dozen pink rosebuds&mdash;Black
had never bought florist&#8217;s roses in armfuls&mdash;but somehow
he had felt he must take them. How account for this
impulse&mdash;since the Scotch are not notably impulsive?
But&mdash;right here it will have to be confessed that Black
had in his veins decidedly more than a trace of Irish blood.
And now it&#8217;s out&mdash;and his future history may be better
understood for the admission.</p>

<p>Some time after Black had caught his trolley, R. P.
Burns, M.D., brought his car to a hurried standstill in
front of Jane Ray&#8217;s shop in the side street, and all but
ran inside. The shop was empty at the moment, and
Jane came forward at his call. He put a quick question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard anything of Sadie Dunstan lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;for a long time. I can&#8217;t even find out where
she has gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you&mdash;but it will startle you. There&#8217;s no
time to break it gently, or I would. She got into trouble,
and&mdash;came home to&mdash;die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was looking him straight in the face as he spoke,
and he saw the news shock her, as he had known it would.
Sadie Dunstan was a little, fair-haired girl who had been
Jane&#8217;s helper in the shop for a year, and in whom Jane had
taken great interest. Then she had gone away&mdash;West
somewhere&mdash;had written once or twice&mdash;had failed to
write&mdash;Jane had unwillingly lost track of her. And now&mdash;here
was Burns and his news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she? Is she&mdash;still living?&#8221; Jane&#8217;s usually
steady voice was unsteady.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She&#8217;s to be buried&mdash;within the hour. I just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
found it out&mdash;and came for you. I thought you might
like to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be ready in three minutes. I&#8217;ll lock the shop&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it was that two more people were shortly on their
way to the place where little Sadie Dunstan, unhonoured
and unmourned&mdash;except for one&mdash;lay waiting for the last
offices earth could give her. But she was to have greater
dignity shown her than she could have hoped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did try to make a real woman of her,&#8221; said Jane, in a
smothered voice, when Red had told her what he knew
of the pitiful story. Passing the small house that morning
he had seen the sign upon the door, and remembering
Jane Ray&#8217;s lost prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, had stopped to inquire. A
neighbour had given him the tragic little history; the old
grandmother, deaf and half blind in her chimney corner,
had added a harsh comment or two; and only a young girl
who said she was Sadie&#8217;s sister and had but an hour before
suddenly appeared from the unknown, had shown that
she cared what had happened to Sadie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did a lot for her,&#8221; asserted Burns. &#8220;I think the
girl meant to be straight. This was one of those under-promise-of-marriage
affairs which get the weak ones now
and then. Poor little girl&mdash;she wouldn&#8217;t have wanted you
to know&mdash;or me. She didn&#8217;t give me a chance&mdash;though
there probably wasn&#8217;t one, anyway, by the time she got
back here. I&#8217;ve had her under my care many a time in
her girlhood, you know&mdash;she was a frail little thing, but
mighty appealing. This younger sister is a good deal
like her, as she looked when you took her first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew she had a sister, but thought she was far away
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In an orphanage till this last year. She&#8217;s only sixteen&mdash;a
flower of a girl&mdash;and crying her heart out for Sadie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
The grandmother&#8217;s a brute&mdash;the child can&#8217;t stay with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll not have to. I can make it up to Sadie&mdash;and I
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burns looked at the face in profile beside him. Jane
Ray had a profile which might have been characterized
as sturdily sweet; the lines were extremely attractive.
Jane&#8217;s quiet dress, the simple hat upon her head, were the
last word in expensive, well-conceived fashion, but Burns
did not know this. He only knew that Miss Ray always
looked precisely as she ought to look&mdash;very nice, and a
little distinguished, so that one noticed her approvingly,
and people who did not know her usually wondered who
she was. He was thinking as he glanced at her now that
if she meant to make it up to Sadie by taking her young
sister under her care, that sister would have an even better
chance than Sadie had had&mdash;and lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had brought some flowers,&#8221; Jane said suddenly,
as the car flew past the last houses of the main
highway and began to climb the hills into the country
backroads. &#8220;This is such a benighted little spot we&#8217;re
going to&mdash;they may not have any at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doubt it. But there wasn&#8217;t time to hunt up flowers
if we wanted to get there. Munson&#8217;s in all kinds of a
hurry to get this thing over. It&#8217;s his busy day&mdash;as usual,
when it happens to be a poor case. We&#8217;ll do well if we
make it now. Not much use in coming&mdash;there&#8217;ll be no
service. But we can at least see the box go down!&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke grimly. But Jane had caught sight of a rose-bush
in a dooryard crowded with white roses, and cried
out imperiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop one minute, please, Doctor Burns. I&#8217;ll buy those
roses or steal them. Please!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>The brakes ground, and Jane was out before the car
stopped, pulling out a plump little purse as she ran. A
countrywoman hurrying to her door to protest angrily at
the spectacle of a girl filling her arms with white roses
was met with the call: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you a dollar
for them&mdash;please don&#8217;t stop me. It&#8217;s for a funeral, and
we&#8217;re late now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Highway robbery,&#8221; commented Burns, as Jane sprang
in beside him. &#8220;But she&#8217;d have sold you her soul for a
dollar&mdash;and dear at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t talk about souls, up here,&#8221; Jane protested.
&#8220;If your fine new man at the Stone Church wanted a job
worth while he&#8217;d leave the smug people in the high-priced
pews and come up here to look after barbarians who&#8217;ll
bury a poor girl without a prayer. Don&#8217;t I know, without
your telling me, that there&#8217;ll be no prayer?&mdash;unless you
make one?&#8221; She looked at him with sudden challenge.
&#8220;I dare you to!&#8221; she said, under her breath.</p>

<p>Burns&#8217; hazel glance, with a kindling fire in it, met hers.
&#8220;I take the dare,&#8221; he answered, without hesitation. &#8220;I
know the Lord&#8217;s Prayer&mdash;and the Twenty Third Psalm.
I&#8217;m not afraid to say them&mdash;for Sadie Dunstan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cynicism in Jane&#8217;s beautifully cut lips melted unexpectedly
into a quiver, and she was silent after that,
till the car dashed up the last steep hill. They came out
at the top almost in the dooryard of a small, weather-beaten
cottage in front of which stood an undertaker&#8217;s
wagon, two men, and half a dozen women. These people
were just about to go into the house, but stood back to let
Doctor Burns&mdash;whom all of them knew&mdash;and Miss Ray&mdash;whom
one of them knew&mdash;go in ahead.</p>

<p>As she went up the steps Jane braced herself for what
she must see. Little fair-haired Sadie&mdash;come to this so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
early&mdash;so tragically&mdash;and nobody to care&mdash;nobody to
say a prayer&mdash;except a red-headed doctor, whose business
it was not. At least&mdash;she had an armful of white roses.
She wanted to take one look at Sadie&mdash;and then lay the
roses so that they would cover her from the sight of the
hard eyes all about her. She would do that&mdash;just that.
Why not? What better could she do? She drew her
breath deep, and set her lips, and walked into the poor
little room....</p>

<p>The thing she saw first was a glowing handful of wonderful
pink rosebuds upon the top of the cheap black box&mdash;one
could not dignify it by any other word than Burns
had used&mdash;which held the chief position in the room.
And then, at the foot of the box, she saw a tall figure with
an open book in his hand come to do Sadie Dunstan
honour. Jane Ray caught back the sob of relief which
had all but leaped to her lips. She had not known, until
that moment, how much she had wanted that prayer&mdash;she,
who did not pray&mdash;or thought she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. Munson, in a hurry, watch in hand, allowed the few
neighbours who had come barely time to crowd into the
small room before he signalled the minister to go ahead
and get it over. He was not an unfeeling man, but he had
two more services on for the day&mdash;costly affairs&mdash;and
both his assistants were ill, worse luck!, and he had had
to look after this country backwoods burial himself. He
had noted with some surprise the appearance of Doctor
Burns and Miss Ray, though there was no use in ever
being surprised at anything the erratic doctor might do.
As for Miss Ray&mdash;he admired her very much, both for
her charming personality and her business ability, which
compelled everybody&#8217;s respect. He wondered what on
earth brought her here&mdash;what brought all three of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
here, slowing things up when the body might have been
committed to the dust with the throwing of a few clods
by his own competent fingers&mdash;and everybody in this
heathen community better satisfied than the Stone Church
man was likely to make them with his ritual. Thus
thought Mr. Munson in his own heart, and all but showed
it in his face.</p>

<p>But Black, though he held his book in his hand, gave
them no ritual&mdash;not here in the house. He had meant
to read the usual service, abbreviating and modifying it
as he must. But somehow, as he had noted one face after
the other&mdash;the impassive faces of the few men and women,
the surlily stoic one of the old grandmother, the tear-wet
one of the wretched young sister in her shabby short
frock&mdash;and then had glanced just once at the set jaw of
R. P. Burns and the desperate pity in the dark eyes of
Jane Ray, he had felt impelled to change his plan.</p>

<p>Red, listening, now heard Black pray, as a man prays
whose heart is very full, but whose mind and lips can do
his bidding under stress. It was a very simple prayer&mdash;it
could not be otherwise because Black was praying with
just one desire in his heart, to reach and be understood
by the one real mourner there before him. It is quite
possible that he remembered less the One to whom he
spoke than this little one by whom he wanted to be heard.
It was for the little sobbing sister that he formulated each
direct, heart-touching phrase, that she might know that
after all there was Someone&mdash;a very great and pitiful
Someone&mdash;who knew and cared because she had lost all
she had in a hard and unpitiful world. And speaking
thus, for her alone, Black quite forgot that Red was listening&mdash;and
Red, somehow, knew that he forgot.</p>

<p>Jane Ray listened, too&mdash;it was not possible to do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
else. Jane had never heard any one pray like that;
she had not known it was ever done. It was at that
moment that she first knew that the man who was speaking
was a real man; such words could have been so spoken
by no man who was not real, no matter how clever an actor
he might be. Something in Jane&#8217;s heart which had been
hard toward any man of Black&#8217;s profession&mdash;because
she had known one or two whom she could not respect,
and had trusted none of them on that account&mdash;softened
a little while Black prayed. At least&mdash;this man was real.
And she was glad&mdash;oh, glad&mdash;that he was saying words
like these over the fair, still head of Sadie Dunstan, and
that the little sister, who looked so like her that the sight
of her shook Jane&#8217;s heart, could hear.</p>

<p>Jane still held her roses when, after a while, the whole
small group stood in the barren, ill-kept burial place which
was all this poor community had in which to bestow its
dead. It was only across the road and over the hill by a
few rods, and when Mr. Munson had been about to send
Sadie in his wagon, Black had whispered a word in his ear,
and then had taken his place at one side of the black box
with its glowing roses on the top. Red, discerning his
intention, had taken two strides to the other side, displacing
a shambling figure of a man who was slowly approaching
for this duty. Mr. Munson, now seeing a revealing
light, waved the unwilling bearer aside, and himself
took the other end of the box. Together the three, looking
like very fine gentlemen all&mdash;in contrast to those who followed&mdash;bore
Sadie in decorum to her last resting place.</p>

<p>Now came the ritual indeed&mdash;every word of it&mdash;brief
and beautiful, with its great phrases. When Mr. Munson,
clods in hand, cast them at the moment&mdash;&#8220;<i>ashes to ashes,
dust to dust</i>,&#8221;&mdash;Jane flung her white roses so swiftly down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
after them that the little sister never saw the dark earth
fall. Then she turned and took the trembling young
figure in her own warm arms&mdash;and looking up, over Sue&#8217;s
head, Jane&#8217;s eyes, dark with tears, met full the understanding,
joyfully approving eyes of Robert Black....</p>

<p>Striding down the hill, presently, having refused the
offer of Mr. Munson to take him back in his own small
car, Black was passed by Red and Jane, with a shabby
little figure between them. At the foot of the hill the
car stopped, and waited for Black to catch up. He came
to its side, hat in hand, his eyes friendlily on Sue Dunstan,
who looked up at him shyly through red lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you ride on the running board&mdash;at least till we
get to the trolley?&#8221; offered Red. &#8220;I thought you had
gone with Munson. What&#8217;s the matter? Was he in too
much of a hurry to look after the minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he asked me. But I want to walk, thank you.
I&#8217;m pretty fond of the country, and don&#8217;t often get so far
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very good of you to come,&#8221; said Jane Ray,
gravely. &#8220;It&mdash;made all the difference. Mr. Munson
told us he didn&#8217;t ask you&mdash;you offered. But it&#8217;s impossible
not to wonder how you knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My housekeeper came from somewhere near this
region&mdash;she told me. It was very easy to come&mdash;easier
than to stay away, after knowing. What a day this is&mdash;and
what a view! Don&#8217;t let me keep you&mdash;good-bye.&#8221;
And he turned away even before Red, always in a hurry
though he was, would have suggestively speeded his throbbing
motor&mdash;a device by which he was accustomed to
make a get-away from a passer-by who had held him up.
As he went on Red put out an arm and waved a parting
salute to the man behind him, at which Black, seeing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
friendly signal, smiled at the landscape in general, addressing
it thus:</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t do that, Red-Head, if you weren&#8217;t beginning
to like me just a bit&mdash;now would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The car was barely out of sight when he heard a shriek
behind him, and turning, found himself pursued by one
of the women who had been in the cottage. She was
waving a parcel at him&mdash;a small parcel done up in a ragged
piece of newspaper, as he saw when he had returned to
meet her. She explained that it contained some few belongings
of Sue Dunstan which the girl had forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ain&#8217;t much, but she might want &#8217;em. She won&#8217;t
be comin&#8217; back, I guess&mdash;not if that Miss Ray keeps her
that kept Sade before. She better keep a lookout on
Sue&mdash;she&#8217;s the same blood, an&#8217; it ain&#8217;t no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you&mdash;I&#8217;ll take this to her,&#8221; Black agreed. His
hat was off, as if she had been a lady, this unkempt woman
who regarded him curiously. He was saying to himself
that here was a place to which he must come again, it
was so near&mdash;and yet so very, very far.</p>

<p>She would have stayed him to gossip about both Sadie
and Sue, but he would have none of that, turned the talk
his own way, and presently got away as adroitly as ever
Red had done, leaving her looking after him with an expression
of mingled wonder and admiration. Somehow
he had given her the impression of his friendliness, and
his democracy&mdash;and yet of the difference between herself
and him. There was, once, a Man, beside a wayside well,
who had given that same impression.</p>

<p>Until late evening he was busy; calls&mdash;a manse wedding&mdash;a
committee meeting&mdash;an hour&#8217;s study&mdash;so the rest
of the June day went. But just as dusk was falling he
tucked the newspaper parcel under his arm and went down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Jane Ray&#8217;s side street. He did not know at all if she
could be found at this hour, but he had an idea that Jane
lived above her shop, and that if she were at home a bell
which he had seen beside the door would bring her.</p>

<p>The shop was softly lighted with many candles,
though no one seemed to be inside. When he tried the
door, however, it was locked, and he rang the bell. A
minute later he saw Jane coming through the shop from
the back, and the suggestion of the hostess moving
through attractive apartments was more vivid than ever.
The door opened. Black held out his parcel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to bother you at this hour, Miss Ray, but
I believe it&#8217;s something the little girl left behind, and I
thought she might want it to-night. I couldn&#8217;t get here
earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you! Won&#8217;t you come in a minute and see
Sue? I&#8217;d like you to see how different&mdash;and how dear&mdash;she
looks. She&#8217;s just back in the garden.&#8221; Jane&#8217;s expression
was eager&mdash;not at all businesslike. She might
have been a young mother offering to show her child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Garden?&#8221; questioned Black, following Jane through
the candle-lighted shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;Actually a garden. You wouldn&#8217;t think it, would you?
But there is one&mdash;a very tiny one&mdash;and it&#8217;s the joy of my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the back of the shop she opened a door into one of
the most inviting little rooms Black ever had seen&mdash;or
dreamed of. Not crowded with antiques or curios&mdash;just
a simple home room, furnished and hung with the most
exquisite taste&mdash;a very jewel of a room, and lighted with
a low lamp which threw into relief the dark polished surface
of a table upon which stood a long row of finely bound
books. But he was led quickly through this&mdash;though he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
wanted to linger and look about him&mdash;through an outer
door of glass which opened directly upon the garden.
<i>Well!</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very much,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;as gardens go&mdash;but
I&#8217;m terribly proud of it, just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful!&#8221; Black exclaimed. &#8220;What a spot&mdash;among
all these old brick buildings! Why&mdash;it looks like
an English garden; every bit of space used&mdash;and all those
trim walks&mdash;and the seat under the trees. Great!&#8221; And
his eye dwelt delightedly on the box borders filled with
flowers, on the tall rows of blue delphiniums and hollyhocks
against the walls, on the one great elm tree at the
back of it all beneath which stood a rustic seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;But here&#8217;s something better yet,&#8221; said Jane&#8217;s voice
quietly, beside him, and she brought him out upon the
narrow, vine-hung porch which ran all across the back of
the house. Here, on a footstool beside a big chair, sat
Sue Dunstan, a little figure all in white, with hair in shining
fair order as if it had just been washed and brushed, and
shy eyes no longer red with tears. And Sue looked&mdash;yes,
she looked as if she had forgotten everything in the world&mdash;except
to love Jane Ray!</p>

<p>And then&mdash;she recognized the man who had stood at her
sister&#8217;s feet that morning and said strange words which had
somehow comforted her. A flood of colour rushed into her
cheeks&mdash;she crouched upon the footstool, not daring to
look up again. Black sat down in the chair beside her&mdash;he
knew Jane had been sitting there before him. He
said Miss Ray had let him come out for just a minute to
see the garden, and wasn&#8217;t it a beautiful garden? He had
known a garden something like that once, he said, and
never another since, and he wondered if he could make one
like it behind his house. Sue wasn&#8217;t sure&mdash;she shook her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
head&mdash;she seemed to think no one but Miss Ray could
make such a garden.</p>

<p>Black didn&#8217;t stay long&mdash;he knew he wasn&#8217;t expected
to. But he had made friends with Sue before he
went&mdash;poor child, who had no friends. And he almost
thought he had made friends with Jane Ray, too. Somehow
he found himself wanting to do that&mdash;he didn&#8217;t quite
know why. Perhaps it was because she was very evidently
a friend of Red. Yes&mdash;he thought that must be
the reason why she interested him so much.</p>

<p>As they came back through the shop Jane paused to
snuff a flaming candle with an old pair of brass snuffers&mdash;her
face was full of colour in the rosy light&mdash;and remarked,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have an exhibition of war posters some
evening before long, Mr. Black&mdash;for the benefit of French
and Belgian orphans. Would you care to speak of it
among your friends? I think you saw some of the first
posters I received. I have more and very wonderful ones
now&mdash;many of them quite rare already. I want to attract
the people with plenty of money&mdash;and some interest in
things over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be delighted to mention it in church next Sunday,&#8221;
Black offered promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t know why not. I supposed you would. Your
church people&mdash;they don&#8217;t like&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they?&mdash;I&#8217;ll be all the more delighted to mention
the war posters, then. Thank you for giving me the
chance. And for showing me the garden&mdash;and Sue.
She&#8217;s a lucky girl&mdash;and so are you, aren&#8217;t you?&mdash;to have
such a chance. You&#8217;ll make the most of it. Miss Ray,
I think Sue never heard of&mdash;Somebody she ought to know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
She needs Him&mdash;even more than she needs you. Teach
her the story of Him&mdash;will you? You don&#8217;t mind my
saying it? You couldn&#8217;t mind&mdash;you care for her! Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane Ray looked after the tall figure, striding swiftly
away up the side street through the June twilight.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly aren&#8217;t afraid,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;to say exactly
what you think. I like you for that, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<small>PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ROBERT BLACK was dressing for a dinner&mdash;a men&#8217;s
dinner, to which Samuel Lockhart had invited him,
and Tom Lockhart had commanded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve got to be there,&#8221; Tom had explained.
&#8220;And Dad always asks a lot of ponderous old personages
who bore you to death&mdash;or else make you red with rage
at some of their fossil ideas. The only thing that saves
the case for me to-night is that you&#8217;re coming. I&#8217;ve
stipulated that I sit near you&mdash;see? Mother wouldn&#8217;t
hear of my being next you&mdash;that honour is reserved for one
of your trustees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you I&#8217;m immensely flattered,&#8221; Black had replied,
with a real sense of warmth about the heart. He
had grown steadily fonder of this interesting boy who was
all but a man. &#8220;But isn&#8217;t your good friend Doctor Burns
to be there? Surely he&#8217;d save anybody from boredom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Tom&#8217;s tone was mocking. &#8220;Yes, he&#8217;ll
be there&mdash;after he comes&mdash;and before he goes. He&#8217;ll
come in just in time for the salad&mdash;no evening dress, just
good old homespun, because he&#8217;s had no time to change.
Then he&#8217;ll be called out before the coffee and the smokes&mdash;but
he&#8217;ll ask for a cup, just the same, and swallow it
standing. Then he&#8217;ll go out&mdash;and all the lights&#8217;ll go out
for me with him&mdash;except, that you&#8217;re there to keep the
brain fires burning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Black had laughed at this dismal picture and had
told the youngster that he would endeavour to save his
life in the crisis. But now, as he dressed, he was not
looking forward to the event. To tell the truth, although
he had been present at many college and fraternity banquets,
this was actually his first experience at a formal
dinner in a private home. He was even experiencing a
few doubts as to how to dress.</p>

<p>Good judgment, however, assured him that the one
safe decision for a clerical diner-out was clerical dress.
Having satisfied himself that every hair was in place, but
having found one of his accessories missing, he went in
search of Mrs. Hodder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to find a handkerchief in my drawer, Mrs.
Hodder,&#8221; he announced, standing in the doorway of the
kitchen and glancing suggestively toward a basketful of
unironed clothes below the table at which his housekeeper
sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t, Mr. Black?&#8221; Mrs. Hodder exclaimed.
&#8220;Mercy me&mdash;I&#8217;ll iron you one in a jiffy. If I may make
so bold as to say so, sir, it&#8217;s not my fault. You use handkerchiefs
rather lavish for one who&mdash;who owns so few.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I enough? I&#8217;ll get some more at once. Do
I&mdash;do you mind telling me if I look as if I were going out
to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>The housekeeper turned and surveyed him. Approval
lighted her previously sombre eye. &#8220;You look as if you
were just going to get married,&#8221; she observed.</p>

<p>An explosion of unclerical-like laughter answered her.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m dressed no differently from the way I am on
Sundays,&#8221; he reminded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have your gown on in the pulpit. And the minute
you come home you&#8217;re out of that long coat and into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
short one. I&#8217;ve never seen you stay looking the way you
do now five minutes, Mr. Black.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be why I&#8217;m so unhappy now. I&#8217;ve got to
stay in this coat for an entire evening. Pity me, Mrs.
Hodder! And don&#8217;t wait up, please. I may be rather
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>He marched away, followed by the adoring gaze of his
housekeeper. Mrs. Hodder&#8217;s austerity of countenance
belied her softness of heart. If the minister had guessed
how like a mother she felt toward him he might have been
both touched and alarmed.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Lockharts&#8217;, he found himself welcomed
first by Tom, who met him, as if accidentally, at the very
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;The heavy-weights are all here,&#8221; announced the boy
under his breath, his arm linked in Black&#8217;s, as he led his
friend upstairs. &#8220;Bald&mdash;half of &#8217;em are bald! And the
rest look as solemn as if this were a funeral instead of a
dinner. Maybe they feel that way. I&#8217;m sure I do. I
say&mdash;don&#8217;t you wish we could jump into my car and burn
it down the road about fifty miles into the moonlight?
There&#8217;s a gorgeous moon to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask me after the dinner is over, and I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Will you? You won&#8217;t&mdash;no such luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try me and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I will. See here&mdash;you promise? It&#8217;ll be
late, I warn you. Father&#8217;s dinners drag on till kingdom
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any time before morning.&#8221; And Black looked into
the laughing, incredulous eyes of the youth before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re no minister,&#8221; Tom chuckled. &#8220;You&#8217;re a dead
game sport.&#8221; Then he drew back suddenly at the flash
in the black eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a mistake about that,&#8221; suggested Black,
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I guess you are a minister, all right,&#8221; admitted
Tom, respectfully. &#8220;And I guess perhaps I want you to
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sure you do.&#8221; Black smiled again. &#8220;Did
you think I couldn&#8217;t take a late spin in your car without
compromising my profession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just thought&mdash;for a minute,&#8221; whispered the boy,
&#8220;I saw a bit of a reckless devil look out of your eyes. I
thought&mdash;you wanted to get away, like me, from this
heavy dinner business&mdash;and go to&mdash;just any old place!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I do. But I don&#8217;t intend to think about
moonlight drives till I&#8217;ve done my part here. Come on,
Tom&mdash;let&#8217;s be &#8216;dead game sports&#8217; and help make things go.
Afterward&mdash;we&#8217;ll take the trail with good consciences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to please you. I was going to bolt whenever
R. P. Burns got called out; but I&#8217;ll wait for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be sure he&#8217;ll be called out. Perhaps he
won&#8217;t, for once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a chance. Wait and see,&#8221; prophesied Tom; and
together they descended the stairs.</p>

<p>Tom stood off at one side, after that, with the apparent
deference of youth. His eyes were sharp with interest
in Black, whose presence relieved for him the tedium of
the affair. He saw the minister shaking hands, making
acquaintances, joining groups, with a certain straightforwardness
of manner which pleased the critical youth immensely.
Like most young men, he despised what is easily
recognized in any company as that peculiar clerical atmosphere
which surrounds so many men of Black&#8217;s profession.
He didn&#8217;t want a minister to bow a little lower,
hold the proffered hand a little longer, speak in a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
more unctuous tone than other men. He wanted his
minister to hold his head high, to make no attempts to
ingratiate himself into his companions&#8217; good graces by
saying things too patently calculated to please them; he
didn&#8217;t want him to agree with everybody&mdash;he wanted
him to differ with them healthily often. As he watched
Black&#8217;s way of looking a new acquaintance straight in
the eye, as if to discover what manner of man he was, and
then of letting the other man take the lead in conversation
instead of instantly and skillfully assuming the
lead, as if he considered himself a born dictator of the
thoughts and words of others&mdash;well&mdash;Tom said to himself
once more that he was jolly glad Robert McPherson Black
had come to this parish. Since it always devolved upon
the Lockhart family to show first friendliness to new incumbents
of that parish, it mattered much to Tom that
he could heartily like this man. He was even beginning
to think of him as his friend&mdash;his special friend. And as,
from time to time, his eyes met Black&#8217;s across the room,
he had a warm consciousness that Black had not forgotten
but was looking forward to the hour that should release
them both for that fast drive down the empty, moonlit
road. Reward enough for a dull evening, that would be,
to take the black-eyed Scotsman for such a whirl across
country as he probably had never known!</p>

<p>But first&mdash;the dinner! And Red hadn&#8217;t come&mdash;of
course he hadn&#8217;t&mdash;when the party moved out to the dining-room
and took their places at the big table with its impressive
centrepiece of lights and flowers, its rather
gorgeous layout of silver and glass, and its waiting attendants.
Red hadn&#8217;t arrived when the soup and fish had
come and gone; when the roast fowl was served; it wasn&#8217;t
till Tom had begun to give him up that the big doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
suddenly put his red head in at the door and stood there
looking silently in upon the company. Tom sprang up
joyfully, and rushed across the room. Red came forward,
shook hands with his host, and took his place&mdash;opposite
Black, as it happened.</p>

<p>And instantly&mdash;to two people at least&mdash;the room was
another place. It&#8217;s Stevenson, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;who mentions
that phenomenon we have all so many times observed&mdash;that
the entrance of some certain person into a room makes
it seem &#8220;as if another candle had been lighted!&#8221; Wonderful
phrase that&mdash;and blessed people of whom it can
be said! Of such people, certainly R. P. Burns, M.D.,
was a remarkable type. Nobody like him for turning on
not only one but fifty candlepower.</p>

<p>Yet all he did was to sit down&mdash;in his customary gray
suit, quite as Tom had said he would, having had no time
to change&mdash;grin round the table, and say, &#8220;Going to feed
me up from the beginning, Lockhart? Oh, never mind.
A good plateful of whatever fowl you&#8217;ve had, and a cup of
coffee will suit me down to the ground. Coffee not served
yet, Parker?&#8221; He turned to the manservant at his elbow.
&#8220;But you see&#8221;&mdash;with an appealing glance at his host&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve
had no lunch to-day&mdash;and it&#8217;s nearly ten. I&#8217;m just
about ready for that coffee.&#8221; Then he surveyed again
the hitherto serious gentlemen about him, who were now
looking suddenly genial, and remarked, &#8220;You fellows don&#8217;t
know what it is to be hungry. No one here but me has
done an honest day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind telling us what time yours began, Doctor
Burns?&#8221; asked Black, across the table.</p>

<p>The hazel eyes encountered the black ones for the second
time. Black had been the first man Red looked at as he sat
down&mdash;his greeting grin had therefore started with Black.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Twelve-five <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> No thanks to me. I gave the
fellow blue blazes for calling me, but he was one of those
persistent chaps, and rang me up every ten minutes till
I gave in and went.... Excuse the shop....
What were you all talking about? Keep it up, please,
while I employ myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somebody told him they had been talking about the
Great War in Europe&mdash;and received a quick, rather
cynical glance from the hazel eyes. Somebody else observed
that it was to be hoped we&#8217;d keep our heads and
not get into it&mdash;and had a fiery glance shot at him, decidedly
disdainful. Then a third man said sadly that he
had a son who was giving him trouble, wanting to go and
enlist with the Canadians, and he wished he knew how
to talk sense into the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better thank the Lord you&#8217;ve bred such a lad!&#8221;
ejaculated Red, between two gulps of coffee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am proud of his spirit,&#8221; admitted the unhappy
father. &#8220;But there&#8217;s no possible reason why he
should do such a wild thing. His mother is nearly out of
her mind with fear that if we keep on opposing him he&#8217;ll
run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he does, you&#8217;ll wish you had sent him willingly, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221; suggested Black. &#8220;Why not let him go?&#8221;</p>

<p>William Jennings, treasurer of Black&#8217;s church, turned
on his minister an astonished eye. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to
say <i>you</i> say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I have three young nephews over there,
in the Scottish ranks. They need all the help they can
have from us. If we don&#8217;t get in as a country pretty soon
now&mdash;more than your boy will run away. Look at the
fellows who&#8217;ve already gone from our colleges, and more
going all the time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;Mr. Black,&#8221;&mdash;a solemn voice spoke from down the
table&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve been given to understand you are in sympathy
with war. I can hardly believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black looked at the speaker, and his eyes sparkled with
a sudden fire. &#8220;That&#8217;s rather a strange way of putting
it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Perhaps you might rather say I am in
sympathy with those who have had war thrust upon them.
What else is there to do but to make war back&mdash;to end
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other ways&mdash;there must be. A great Christian
nation must use those ways&mdash;not throw itself blindly
into the horrible carnage. Our part is to teach the world
the lesson of peace as Christ did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did He teach it?&#8221; The question came back, like
a shot.</p>

<p>The man who had spoken delayed a little, finding it
difficult to formulate his answer. &#8220;Why, by His life, His
example, His precepts&mdash;&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was the Man
of Peace&mdash;He told us to turn the other cheek&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Red&#8217;s keen eyes were on Black now. He had opened
his own lips, in his own impulsive way&mdash;and had closed
them as quickly. &#8220;What&#8217;s in you?&#8221; his eyes said to
Black. &#8220;Have you got it in you to down this fool? Or
must I?&#8221; And he forgot how hungry he was.</p>

<p>When Black spoke, every other eye was on him as well.
He spoke quietly enough, yet his words rang with conviction.
&#8220;My Christ,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if He were on earth now,
and the enemy were threatening Mary, His mother, or
the other Mary, or the little children He had called to
Him, would seize the sword in His own hand, to defend
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red sat back. Over his face swept a flame of relief.
Tom breathed quickly. Samuel Lockhart glanced about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
him, and saw on some faces startled approval and on
others astonishment and anger.</p>

<p>Then the talk raged&mdash;of course. This was in those
days, already difficult to recall, when men differed about
the part America should take in the conflict; when dread
of involvement called forth strange arguments, unsound
logic; when personal fear for their sons made fathers
stultify themselves by advocating a course which should
keep the boys out of danger. Several of the guests at
Mr. Lockhart&#8217;s table were fathers of sons in college&mdash;substantial
business or professional men alive with fear
that the war sentiment flaming at the great centres of
education would catch the tow and tinder of the young
men&#8217;s imagination, and that before long, whether America
should declare war or not, instead of isolated enlistments
the whole flower of the country&#8217;s youth would be off for
the scene of the great disaster.</p>

<p>Suddenly Red brought his fist down on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re afraid,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;of the personal issue, you
fellows! Forget that you have sons&mdash;let the sons forget
that they have fathers. What&#8217;s America&#8217;s plain duty?
Good God&mdash;it&#8217;s as plain as a pikestaff! She&#8217;s got to get
in&mdash;to keep her own self-respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to save her own soul,&#8221; added Black; and again
the eyes of the two men met across the table.</p>

<p>It was at this instant that Tom Lockhart took fire.
Up to these last words of Red and Black he had been
merely intensely interested and excited; now, suddenly,
he was aglow with eagerness to show where he stood, he
of the class who in all wars are first to offer themselves.
Almost before he knew it he had spoken, breaking
the silence which had succeeded upon Black&#8217;s grave
words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go,&#8221; he said, and a great flush spread over
his fair young face to the roots of his thick, sandy hair.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, the table was in an uproar&mdash;a subdued
uproar, to be sure, but none the less throbbing with contrary
opinion. As for Samuel Lockhart himself, he could
only stare incredulously at his boy, but the other men,
with the exception of the doctor and the minister, were
instantly upon Tom with hurried words of disapproval.
William Jennings, who sat next him, turned and laid a
remonstrating hand on Tom&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; he said, fiercely&mdash;it was he whose son was
likely to enlist with Canada&mdash;&#8220;you don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;re talking about. For Heaven&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t lose your
head like my George! There isn&#8217;t any call for you youngsters
to take this thing seriously&mdash;leave it to the ones who
are of military age, at least. They&#8217;ve got enough men
over there, anyway, to see this war through; if we send
money and munitions, the way we are doing, that&#8217;s our
part, and a big part it is, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Tom found himself wishing in a way that he
hadn&#8217;t spoken up, since it had brought all the heavy-weights
down on his undeniably boyish self. And yet,
somehow, when he had glanced just once at Red and
Black, he couldn&#8217;t be entirely sorry. Both had given him
a look which he would have done much to earn, and neither
had said a word of remonstrance.</p>

<p>Yet, after the dinner, his impression that they were
both eager to have him carry his expression of willingness
into that of a fixed purpose, suffered an unexpected change.
As they rose from the table, at a late hour, Red&mdash;who had
not been called out yet after all&mdash;slipped his arm through
Tom&#8217;s, and spoke in his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud of you, lad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I want you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
think this thing through to the end. Duty sometimes
takes one form and sometimes another. I&#8217;ve been watching
your father, and&mdash;you see&mdash;you dealt him a pretty
heavy blow to-night, and he hasn&#8217;t been quite the same
man since. Go slow&mdash;that&#8217;s only fair to him. You&#8217;re not
twenty-one yet, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty near. Next January.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep cool till then. We may be in it as a country by
then&mdash;I hope so. If we are&mdash;perhaps you and I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom thrilled. &#8220;Will you go, Doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I will! I&#8217;d have been off long ago if&mdash;&mdash; But
I can&#8217;t tell you the reason just now. Some day,
perhaps. Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at Tom, and Tom looked at him. Then,
both of them, for some unexplainable reason, turned and
looked toward Black, whose eyes were following them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose he&#8217;ll go if we do declare war?&#8221; whispered
Tom.</p>

<p>A queer expression crossed Red&#8217;s face. &#8220;They mostly
don&#8217;t&mdash;his class,&#8221; he said, rather contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think&mdash;&#8221; Tom hesitated&mdash;&#8220;he&#8217;s&mdash;just like his
class?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;just like those I&#8217;ve known,&#8221; admitted Red,
grudgingly. &#8220;That is&mdash;on the surface. Can&#8217;t tell how
deep the difference goes, yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>like</i> him!&#8221; avowed Tom, honestly.</p>

<p>Red laughed. &#8220;Good for you!&#8221; he commented. &#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;trying
rather hard not to like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom stared. &#8220;Oh&mdash;why not?&#8221; he questioned, eagerly.</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t hear the explanation of this extraordinary
statement, for one of the older men came up and hauled
him away by the arm, and he had a bad time of it, mostly,
for the rest of the evening. He was only restrained from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
making a bolt and getting away from the house by the
remembrance of Black&#8217;s promise.</p>

<p>The time came, however, when for a moment he feared
it was all up with that moonlight spin. He had just
slipped out upon the porch and assured himself that the
night was continuing to be the finest ever, when he heard
Red inside taking leave. He hurried back, and discovered
that the other men were evidently about to take the
cue and go also. He came around to Black&#8217;s elbow in
time to hear Red address the minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happen to be in the mood for a run of a few miles in
my car?&#8221; Red invited, in his careless way which left a
man free to accept or refuse as he chose. &#8220;I have to see
a patient yet to-night. It was a pretty fine night when
I came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom couldn&#8217;t know&mdash;how could he?&mdash;what, in the circumstances,
it cost Black to reply as he promptly did:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you&mdash;I&#8217;d like nothing better&mdash;except what I&#8217;m
going to have: the same thing with Tom Lockhart.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Tom was a gentleman, and he hastened to release
Black from his promise, though his face plainly showed
his disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please go with the Doctor, if you like, Mr. Black.
His car can put it all over mine&mdash;and he doesn&#8217;t ask anybody
very often&mdash;as I happen to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;m engaged to you, Tom,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m going with you, if you&#8217;ll take me. Mighty sorry
I can&#8217;t be in two places at the same time, Doctor Burns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Red&mdash;and wouldn&#8217;t have admitted
for a farm that he was disappointed. &#8220;As for
Tom&#8217;s car&mdash;it&#8217;s a whale,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and can show my old
Faithful the dust any time. Good-night, then!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whichever was the better car, certain it was that Black,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in Tom&#8217;s, had his first sensation of tremendous speed
during the hour which followed. The boy was excited
by the events of the evening, he was a skillful and daring
driver, and he was conscious of being able to give an older
man a perfectly new experience. Black had frankly told
him that he had never before taken a night drive in a
powerful roadster, with the speed limit whatever the driver
chose to make it. Under this stimulus Tom chose to make
it pretty nearly the extreme of his expensive motor&#8217;s
power. The result was that very soon the minister&#8217;s hat
was in his hand, and his close-cut black hair taking the stiff
breeze, like Tom&#8217;s, as the car gathered herself afresh to fly
down each new stretch of clear road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like it?&#8221; shouted Tom, suddenly, as he slowed down
for a sharp curve.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind how fast we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while I trust you&mdash;as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do trust me, eh?&#8221; The boy&#8217;s voice was exultant.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you know my life is in your hands. You
wouldn&#8217;t risk cutting it short.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motor slackened perceptibly. &#8220;There&#8217;s not the
least danger of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not&mdash;with your hands on the wheel. Go
ahead&mdash;don&#8217;t slow down. You haven&#8217;t shown me yet
quite what the car can do, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;not quite. Pretty near, though. I knew you
were a good sport. Lots of older men get nervous when
we hit&mdash;what we were hitting. Not even R. P. B. drives
in quite that notch&mdash;and he&#8217;s no coward. He says it&#8217;s
all right, if you don&#8217;t happen to throw a tire. I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
expect to throw one&mdash;not at that pace. Never have.
Maybe I better not take any chances with the minister in,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take any that you&#8217;d take for yourself,&#8221; commanded
Black. Tom, diminishing his pace of necessity for a
one-way bridge, glanced quickly round at his companion,
to see what Black&#8217;s face might reveal that his cool speech
did not. He saw no trace of fear in the clean-cut profile
outlined against the almost daylight of the vivid night;
instead he saw a man seemingly at ease under conditions
which usually, Tom reflected, rather strung most fellows
up, old or young.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom spoke his mind: &#8220;You <i>are</i> a good
sport,&#8221; he said, in his ardent young way. &#8220;They mostly
aren&#8217;t, though, in your business, are they?&mdash;honestly
now? <i>You</i> would go to war, though, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he saw a change of expression indeed. Black&#8217;s
lips tightened, his chin seemed to protrude more than
usual&mdash;and, as we have stated before, it was a frankly aggressive
chin at any time. Black&#8217;s head came round, and
his eyes seemed to look straight through Tom&#8217;s into his
cynical young thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; he said&mdash;waited a bit, and then went on, slowly
and with peculiar emphasis&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s just one thing I
can never take peaceably from any man&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
think I have to take it. I have the honour to belong to a
profession which includes thousands of the finest men in
the world&mdash;just as your friend Doctor Burns&#8217; profession
includes thousands of fine men. You&mdash;and others&mdash;never
think of hitting at the profession of medicine and surgery
just because you may happen to know a man here and
there who isn&#8217;t a particularly worthy member of it.
There are quacks and charlatans in medicine&mdash;but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
profession isn&#8217;t judged by them. Is it quite fair to judge
the ministry by some man you have known who didn&#8217;t
seem to measure up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;no, of course not,&#8221; admitted Tom. &#8220;It&#8217;s just
that&mdash;I suppose&mdash;well&mdash;I don&#8217;t think there are so many
of &#8217;em who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Want to drive seventy miles an hour&mdash;at midnight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom laughed boyishly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect that, of
course. But I don&#8217;t like long prayers, to tell the truth;
and most of the sermons find fault with folks because
they don&#8217;t happen to come up to the preacher&#8217;s mark,
and I get fed up on &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like Doctor Burns&#8217; medicine? He set your
leg once, you told me. Did you like that&mdash;especially?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well&mdash;if you want to call sermons medicine&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
began Tom, slyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what many of them are&mdash;or should be&mdash;and
pretty bitter medicine, too, at that, sometimes.
Shouldn&#8217;t a man have your respect who dares to risk
your dislike by giving you the medicine he thinks you
need? Is the man who ventures to stand up and tell you
the plain truth about yourself, whether you like it or not,
exactly a coward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certainly no coward,&#8221; said Tom, with emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever happen to know a minister who you
thought was a coward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly. But&mdash;if you want the truth&mdash;I don&#8217;t
think, if this country should get into war, you&#8217;d see an
awful lot of preachers going into it. Why&mdash;they don&#8217;t
believe in it. They&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see. We shall get into it&mdash;sooner or later&mdash;I
hope sooner. And when we do&mdash;I don&#8217;t think the regiments
will be lacking chaplains.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Oh!&mdash;chaplains!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think that&#8217;s a soft job, do you? Do you happen
to have been reading much about the English and French
chaplains over there, since the war began? And the
priests?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say I have,&#8221; admitted Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only difference that I can find,&#8221; said Black, in a
peculiar quiet tone which when he knew him better Tom
discovered to mean deadly earnestness&mdash;with a bite in it&mdash;&#8220;between
a chaplain&#8217;s job and a fighting man&#8217;s, is that
the right sort of chaplain goes unarmed where the soldier
goes armed&mdash;and takes about as many chances, first and
last. And when it comes to bracing the men&#8217;s courage
before the fight&mdash;and after&mdash;well, I think I covet the chaplain&#8217;s
chance even more than I do the captain&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>They drove in silence after that for exactly three and
three quarter miles, which, at Tom&#8217;s now modified pace,
took about five minutes. Then Black said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t answer the other part of your question, did I,
Tom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About whether you&#8217;d go to war?&#8221; Tom turned, with a
satisfied smile on his lips. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about that.
But I guess you answered it, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock in the morning Tom set Black down before
the manse. For the last half-hour they had had a
jolly talk which had ranged from guns to girls&mdash;and back
again to guns. Black seemed to know more about the
guns than the girls, though he had listened with interest
to Tom&#8217;s remarks upon both subjects, and had contributed
an anecdote or two which had made Tom shout with glee.
When Black stood upon the sidewalk, a tall, straight figure
in the moonlight, he held out his hand, which Tom gripped
eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Thank you for the best hour I&#8217;ve had in a month.
That blew all the fog out of my brain, and put a wonderful
new idea into my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind telling me what it is?&#8221; Tom asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll keep it quiet till I have it under way. Do you
think we can get a group of fellows, friends of yours and
others, to come to my house once a week&mdash;say on Monday
evenings&mdash;to talk over this war situation&mdash;study it up&mdash;discuss
it freely&mdash;and plan what we can do about it, over
here&mdash;before we get over there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I think so?&#8221; Tom&#8217;s tone spoke his pleasure as well
as the chuckling laugh he gave. &#8220;Do I think so? Why,
the fellows will be crazy to come&mdash;after I tell &#8217;em about
this drive and chin of ours. When they know you burned
the road with me at such a clip and never turned a hair,
they&#8217;ll fall over one another to get to your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>He enjoyed to the full the laugh he got back from Black
at that&mdash;a deep-keyed, whole-souled, delightful laugh,
which told of the richness of the man&#8217;s nature. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d drive at a hundred, hours on end,&#8221; declared Black,
&#8220;to have you fall in with my schemes like that. Good-night,
Tom, and we&#8217;ll organize that club to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day, you mean.&#8221; Tom reluctantly gave his motor
the signal.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day. At eight o&#8217;clock to-night. Be on hand early,
will you, Tom&mdash;to help me make things go from the start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sitting on your doorstep at seven thirty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. I&#8217;ll open the door at seven twenty-nine.
Good-night, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Mr. Black.&#8221;</p>

<p>But so slowly did Tom drive away that he was not
out of sight of the manse when the door closed on his
friend the minister.</p>

<small>HIGH LIGHTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THERE!&#8221; said Jane Ray, turning on one last golden
electric bulb cunningly concealed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve used
every device I know to make the showing tell. <i>Is</i> it
effective? <i>Does</i> it all count, Mrs. Burns? I&#8217;ve studied
it so much I don&#8217;t know any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Redfield Pepper Burns stood beside Miss Ray
at one end of the long shop&mdash;a shop no longer&mdash;and looked
down it silently for a full minute before she spoke. Then:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very wonderful,&#8221; she said, in her low, pleasant
voice. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have dreamed that even you could
do it. It <i>is</i> effective&mdash;it <i>does</i> count. The appeal, even
at the first glance, is&mdash;astonishing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is&mdash;where has the shop gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Miss Lockhart, who was on Mrs. Burns&#8217;
other side. All three were in semi-evening dress of a
quiet sort; and the evening hour was just before that set
for the showing of the posters. Jane Ray had decided
against making a public thing of her exhibition; she had
argued that that would mean a large crowd and little
money. A more exclusive affair, with invitations discreetly
extended, ought to fill just comfortably her limited
space, and bring the dollars she coveted for her Belgians.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a shop now&mdash;it&#8217;s a salon,&#8221; declared Mrs. Burns.
Jane glowed at this&mdash;as well she might. Mrs. Burns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
with her wealth, her experience of the world, her personality
of exceeding charm, knew whereof she spoke.
Jane knew well that she could not have found a patroness
of her exhibition whose influence could help her more than
that of the wife of Red Pepper Burns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the word,&#8221; Nan agreed. &#8220;Miss Ray has
done wonders. The shop has always been a perfectly
charming place&mdash;as a shop; but to-night it&#8217;s a colourful
spot to solicit not only the eye but the heart. The
pocket-books and purses will fly open&mdash;I&#8217;m sure of it.
And with Doctor Burns to tell us what we <i>must</i> do&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
no doubt but every poster will be sold to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; Jane said. &#8220;They might be, if the
prices bid run low. But I don&#8217;t want small prices&mdash;I want
big ones&mdash;oh, very big! If people will only understand&mdash;and
care.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shop door opened, and R. P. Burns and Tom Lockhart
came in together, both in evening dress. Tom&#8217;s face
was exultant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got him!&#8221; he called. &#8220;I put out the office lights,
chloroformed the office nurse, hauled him upstairs, drew
his bath, and put his clothes upon him&mdash;and for a finishing
touch, to make all tight, disconnected the telephone.
First occasion ever known where he was present at any
party before the guests arrived&mdash;not to mention being
properly dressed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Red was laughing. He loomed above the group, every
shining red hair in place, his eyes sparkling with eagerness
for the fray. Not in a long time had he had a part to play,
outside his profession, which suited him so well. Himself
war mad from the beginning, impatient a thousand times
over at the apathy of his fellow-citizens under the constantly
growing needs and demands of the world struggle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
he was welcoming the chance to try his hand and voice
at warming the cold hearts, firing the imaginations, and
reaching the pocket-books thus far mostly shoved deep
down in the prosperous pockets. To be here to-night he
had worked like a fiend all day to cover his lists of calls,
to tie up every possible foreseen demand. At the last
moment he had cut half a dozen strings which threatened
to bind him, instructed his office to take no calls for him
for the coming three hours, and had fled away with Tom,
determined for once to do his duty as he saw it, and not as
any persistent patient might see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jolly, but this is a stunning show!&#8221; he commented,
gazing round him. &#8220;What lighting! Why, you must
have run wires everywhere, Jane! That fellow in blue
on the horse, at the far end, looks as if he were galloping
straight out at us. You must have been on a hanging
committee at some art gallery some time or other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never. And Mr. Black is responsible for the first
inspiration about the lighting. He has taken such an
interest. Did you know he got all these Raemakers cartoons
down at the end for me? They just came to-day&mdash;he
had to wire and wire to have them here in time. They&#8217;re
so splendid&mdash;and so terrible&mdash;I&#8217;ve put them all by themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red strode down the room. Nobody joined him while
he stared with intense concentration at the merciless arraignment
of a merciless foe which was in each Raemakers
stroke. He came back with a fresh fire in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I say that will sell those? People will turn
away in holy horror, and say the Dutchman lies. He
hasn&#8217;t told half the truth&mdash;it can&#8217;t be told. I want that
one last on the line myself. I can&#8217;t hang it, but I can put
it away&mdash;and get it out, now and then, when my pity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
slackens. Oh, lord&mdash;how long! Two years and more
those people have been bleeding, and still we stand on the
outside and look on, like gamins at a curbstone fight!
Shame on us!&#8221; And Red ran his hand through his thick,
coppery locks again and again, till they stood on end
above his frowning brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, dear! Here come the first people&mdash;and you are
one of the receiving hosts. You mustn&#8217;t look so savage.
Smooth down your hair&mdash;and smile again!&#8221; His wife
spoke warningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;I&#8217;ll try. Where&#8217;s the minister? I thought
he was going to stand by to-night? He has a better grip
on his feelings than I have. He keeps his hair where it
belongs. I&#8217;m too Irish for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here.&#8221; And Black came up to shake hands,
ahead of the guests who were alighting from a big car outside.
&#8220;I was after just one more poster&mdash;and got it out
of the express office at the last minute. No, I&#8217;m not going
to show it yet. I think it comes later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re all six here&mdash;I&#8217;m so glad,&#8221; whispered Nan
Lockhart. &#8220;Do you know, somehow, I was never so
proud in my life of being one of a receiving group. Nothing
ever seemed so worth while. Mr. Black, it&#8217;s fine of
you to give so much time to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine! It&#8217;s just an escape valve for me, Miss Lockhart.
Besides, what could be better worth doing than
this, just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that I can think of. But it took Jane Ray
to conceive it. Isn&#8217;t she looking beautifully distinguished
to-night, in that perfectly ripping smoke-blue gown, and
her hair so shiningly smooth and close?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ripping?&#8221; repeated Black, his eyes following Miss
Ray as she went forward to welcome her first guests. &#8220;It&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
very plain&mdash;and unobtrusive. I shouldn&#8217;t have noticed it.
She does look distinguished, as you say, but it isn&#8217;t the
dress, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan laughed. &#8220;How that would please her! The
dress is plain and unobtrusive&mdash;and absolutely perfect in
every line! It makes what I&#8217;m wearing look so fussy I
want to go home and change it! Jane has a genius for
knowing how to look like a picture. I suppose that&#8217;s the
artist in her. Do you know, I think the people who are
asked here to-night feel particularly flattered by an invitation
from Jane? Isn&#8217;t that quite an achievement&mdash;for a
shopkeeper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That word doesn&#8217;t seem to apply to her, somehow,&#8221;
said Black, and changed the subject rather abruptly.
Two minutes later he had left Miss Lockhart, to greet
one of his elderly parishioners, a rich widow who bore
down upon him in full sail. Nan Lockhart looked
after him with an amused expression about her well-cut
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t like my calling her a shopkeeper. And
you don&#8217;t intend to discuss any girl with me or anybody
else, do you, Mr. Black?&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;All right&mdash;be
discreet, like the saint you are supposed to be&mdash;and really
are, for the most part, I think. But you&#8217;re pretty human,
too. And Fanny Fitch <i>is</i> wearing a frock and hat to-night
that I think even you will be forced to notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not long before she had an opportunity to test the
truth of this prediction. The room filled rapidly, the
narrow street outside becoming choked with cars. Among
the early comers were Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Lockhart
and Miss Fitch. As Fanny appeared in the ever lengthening
line of arrivals, Nan found herself waiting with interest
for the moment when she should reach Jane Ray<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and Robert Black, who, as it chanced just then, stood near
each other.</p>

<p>No doubt but Miss Fitch was a charmer. Even Nan
was forced to admit that she had never seen Fanny more
radiant. As she glanced from Fanny to Jane and back
again the comparison which occurred to her was that between
a gray-blue pigeon and a bird of Paradise! And
yet&mdash;there was nothing dull about Jane&mdash;and nothing
flaunting about Fanny. It was not a matter of clothes
and colour after all, it was an affair of personality. Jane
was beautifully distinguished in appearance&mdash;Nan had
chosen the right words to describe her&mdash;and Fanny was
exquisitely lovely to look at. And there you were&mdash;simply
nowhere in estimating the two, unless you had something
more to go by than looks. Nan, with intimate
knowledge of Fanny Fitch and an acquaintance with
Jane Ray which offered one of the most interesting attractions
she had ever felt toward a member of her own sex,
found herself wondering how any man who should chance
on this evening to meet them both for the first time might
succeed in characterizing them, afterward, for the benefit,
say, of an invalid mother!</p>

<p>It was great fun, and as good as a play, she reflected, to
see Jane and Fanny meet. If there was the slightest
touch of condescension in Fanny&#8217;s manner as she approached
her hostess, it had no choice but to disappear
before Jane&#8217;s adorable poise. Nobody could condescend
to Jane. It wasn&#8217;t that she didn&#8217;t permit it&mdash;it simply
couldn&#8217;t exist in the presence of that straightforward
young individuality of hers. From the top of her satiny
smooth, high-held, dark head, to the toe of the smart
little slipper which matched the blue of her gown, she was
quietly sure of herself. And beside her some of the town&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
most aristocratic matrons and maids looked decidedly less
the aristocrat than Jane!</p>

<p>Around the edges of the room moved the guests,
in low-voiced smiling orderliness, scanning the posters,
large and small, so cunningly displayed, with every art of
concealed lighting to show them off. The appeal of some
was only in the flaming patriotism of the vigorous lines
and brilliant colouring; in others all the cunning of the
painter&#8217;s brush had wrought to produce a restrained yet
thrilling effect hardly second to that of a finished picture.
The subjects were taken from everywhere; from the
trenches, from No Man&#8217;s Land, from civilian homes,
from the cellars of the outcasts and exiles. And as the
people whom Jane had invited to this strange exhibit
moved on and on, past one heart-stirring sketch to another,
the smiles on many lips died out, and now and then
one saw more than a hint of rising tears quickly suppressed.
Those who could look at that showing, unmoved,
were few.</p>

<p>And yet, presently when Burns was upon his platform,
offering his first poster for sale, though it went quickly,
it was at no high price. Following this, he took the least
appealing; and so on, in due course, and the bids still ran
low. Little by little, however, he forced them up&mdash;considerably
more by the tell-tale expression upon his face,
when he was dissatisfied with a bid, than by what he said.
As an auctioneer, Red had begun his effort a little disappointingly
to those who expected his words, backed
by his personality, to do great things from the start. The
explanation he gave to Jane Ray, in a minute&#8217;s interval,
was undoubtedly the true one.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they were all men, I could bully them into it. Somehow,
these well-dressed women stifle me. I&#8217;m not used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
to facing them, except professionally. What&#8217;s the matter?
Shall I let go and fire straight, at any risk of offending?
They ought to be offering five times as much, you know.
They simply aren&#8217;t taking this thing seriously, and I
don&#8217;t know how to make them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t make them, I don&#8217;t know who could.
Yes, speak plainly&mdash;why not? We ought not to be
getting tens and twenties for such posters as those last
three&mdash;each one should have brought a hundred at least.
Try this one next, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Burns stood straight again. He held up the sheet Jane
offered him. It was a bit of wonderful colouring, showing
a group of French peasants staring up at an airplane high
overhead&mdash;the first British flier on his way to the Front.
The awe, the faith in those watching eyes, was touching.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a hundred for this, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; he called.
&#8220;Start the bid at that, and then send it flying. Never
mind whether you want the poster or not. Some day it
will be valuable&mdash;if not in money, then in sentiment.
Now, then, who speaks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody spoke. Then: &#8220;Oh, come, Doctor,&#8221; said one
rotund gentleman, laughing, &#8220;you can&#8217;t rob us that way.
The thing&#8217;s a cheap, machine-coloured print&mdash;interesting,
certainly, but no more. I&#8217;ll give you ten for it&mdash;that&#8217;s
enough. There&#8217;s just one poster in the whole show that&#8217;s
worth a hundred dollars&mdash;and that&#8217;s the man on the
horse. When you offer that I&#8217;ll be prepared to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man on the horse goes for not a cent under five
hundred,&#8221; declared Burns, fiercely. &#8220;Starts at that&mdash;and
ends at seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;a thousand! Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But he couldn&#8217;t do it. It was a polite, suburban company,
no great wealth in it, just comfortably prosperous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
people, not particularly patriotic as yet. The time was
to come when they would see things differently, but at
that period of the Great War they were mostly cold to the
needs of the sufferers three thousand miles away. They
saw no reason why Jane Ray should invite them to an
exclusive showing of her really quite entertaining
collection, and then expect them to open their pocket-books
into her lap. Each one intended to buy one poster, of
course, out of courtesy to Jane, but&mdash;the lower priced the
better. And all the lower-priced ones were sold. The
bidding went slack, all but died. Burns took out his big
white handkerchief and wiped his brow, smiling ruefully
down at Jane, who nodded encouragingly back. But even
that encouraging nod couldn&#8217;t tell Red how to do it.</p>

<p>Before this distressing stage in the proceedings had been
reached, Black, with a lightning-like working of the mind,
had been making plans of his own in case they should be
needed. He had stood beside Nan Lockhart, at the back
of the room, his arms folded, his eyes watching closely the
scene before him. He did not look at all, as he stood
there, like a man who could take an auctioneer&#8217;s place
and &#8220;get away with it,&#8221; as the modern expressive phrase
goes. In his clerical dress, his dark hair very smooth
above his clear brow, his eyes intent, his lips unconsciously
pressed rather firmly together under the influence of his
anxiety for Burns&#8217; success in the difficult task, Black&#8217;s
appearance suggested rather that of a restrained onlooker
at a race who watches a favourite jockey, than that of one
who longs to leap into the saddle and dash round the
course himself, to win the race. But this was precisely
what he was aching to do.</p>

<p>Deeply as he admired the clever surgeon, much as he
hoped for the friendship of the highly intelligent man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
he was not long in finding out that Red had not been
built for a persuader in public places. If the red-headed
doctor had been confronted with a desperate case of
emergency surgery, he could have flung off his coat, rolled
up his sleeves, commandeered an amateur nurse for an
assistant, and achieved a victory as brilliant as it was
spectacular. Doubtless, Black reflected, if it had been a
matter of partisan politics, and an enemy to the good of the
state had met Red in open debate, the doctor could have
downed him in three rounds by sheer force of clean-cut
argument and an arm thrown high in convincing gesture.
But&mdash;given a roomful of well-to-do people, not overmuch
interested in Belgian orphans, and a man trying to sell
them something they didn&#8217;t want for more than they had
any idea of paying for it&mdash;well&mdash;Red simply couldn&#8217;t do it,
that was all. And Miss Ray, in picking him out for the
job on account of his popularity and his well-known fearlessness
in telling people what they must do&mdash;Miss Ray
had simply missed it, that was all. It was an error in
judgment, and nobody was seeing that more clearly than
Jane herself, as Black discovered by each glance at her.</p>

<p>She was standing at Red&#8217;s elbow, handing him up
posters one by one, and giving the buyer a charming
glance of gratitude for each purchase as she moved forward
to hand the poster spoken for. But her usually
warm colour had receded a little, her lips, between the
smiles, seemed a trifle set, and a peculiar sense of her
disappointment reached across the room and impressed
itself upon Black as definitely as if she had signalled to
him. Just once he caught her eyes, as if in search of his,
and he found himself giving her back a look of sympathy
and understanding. He was longing to come to her aid.
Would it be possible, in any way, to do that? He was accustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
to facing people, in the mass, as Red was not,
and accustomed to handling them, to reading from their
faces what would influence them; in plain words, to being
master of them, and leading them whither they would not
voluntarily go. Would the moment conceivably come when
he could step into the breach and, without offending Red
or seeming presumptuous, take his place?</p>

<p>At least he could be prepared. And as his mind worked,
led by Red&#8217;s very mistakes into seeing what might offset
them, a suggestion suddenly shaped itself. Instantly he
acted upon it. He beckoned Tom Lockhart, took him
quietly aside into the half-lighted rear shop where the big
antique pieces removed from the larger room to make space
crowded one another unmercifully, and spoke under his
breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, you have more nerve than any fellow I know.
Around the corner, on Seventh Street, at the Du Bois&#8217;s,
there&#8217;s a Belgian baby&mdash;came to-day. Please go and
ask them for it, will you?&mdash;and hurry back. Tell them
to pick it out of the cradle just as it is, wrap a shawl around
it, and let you bring it here. They&#8217;re French&mdash;they&#8217;ll
understand&mdash;I was there to-day. Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a smothered whoop Tom was off, and Black
returned to the larger room, remaining, however, near the
door of the back shop. Ten minutes later an eager whisper
through a crack of that door summoned him and he slipped
out to find Tom gingerly holding a bundle from one end
of which protruded a dark little head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he is&mdash;poor little cuss! He&#8217;s about the most
whipped looking specimen I ever saw. Think he&#8217;ll sell a
poster? He&#8217;s sold one already&mdash;blamed if he hasn&#8217;t&mdash;at
the best price Tommy Boy can afford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep him quiet here for a bit, can you, Tom? I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
come for him when I think his chance is ripe. Will he
keep still?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too used to shifting for himself not to keep still, I
guess.&#8221; Tom gazed pityingly into the thin little face
with its big eyes regarding him steadily in the dim light
of the outer room. &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll keep him quiet. But
don&#8217;t hold off the crisis too long. R. P.&#8217;s about at the
end of his wind. First time in my life I ever saw Doctor
in a corner, but he&#8217;s sure in one now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done nobly; we just aren&#8217;t educated up to the
idea yet, that&#8217;s all. Baby may not help out, but we&#8217;ll
try.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black went back. Red turned and gave him a look
as he came in which said, &#8220;I wish I were about a million
miles away from here. How in thunder do you do it?&#8221;
As if the thought were father to the demand he suddenly
beckoned and spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Black, suppose you come up here and tell us about
these last&mdash;and best&mdash;posters. My oratory has run out.
I know you have one poster of your own you haven&#8217;t
shown&mdash;isn&#8217;t it time for that now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black smiled up at him&mdash;a friendly smile which answered:
&#8220;I&#8217;d like nothing better than to help you out,
old fellow!&#8221; But aloud he said: &#8220;Rather a telling one
has just been brought in by Mr. Thomas Lockhart. With
your permission I&#8217;ll be glad to show it to everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he was out of the room and back again,
and the baby&mdash;out of its wrappings, its thin, tiny frame,
pinched face and claw-like hands showing with a dumb
eloquence&mdash;was held cosily in the tall minister&#8217;s left arm,
and his right hand was gently smoothing back the curly
black locks from the wistful little brow. He took one step
upon the platform Red was about to vacate, and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
down into the upturned faces. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go yet, please,
Doctor,&#8221; he requested, in the other&#8217;s ear. Reluctantly
Burns waited, scanning the baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything I can say, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221;
Black began, very quietly, and looking back into the small
face as he went on. &#8220;It&#8217;s all said by this little chap.
He&#8217;s just been brought over to this country, with scores
more, by the Committee for Belgian Relief. A kind-hearted
French family near by have offered to care for him
until a home can be found. The father of this family was
at the pier when the ship came in, saw this baby, and
brought him home with him. It is for hundreds of such
little forlorn creatures as he that Miss Ray wants to raise
the largest sum we are able to give her. We can&#8217;t conceive
how much money is needed, but we can&#8217;t possibly
make the amount too large.&#8221;</p>

<p>The absolute simplicity of this little speech&mdash;for this
was all he said&mdash;coupled with the touching appeal of the
baby in his arms, was what did it; Mrs. Burns and Nan
and Jane all said so afterward. With the instinct for the
right course at the right moment which is the peculiar gift
of the public speaker, Black divined, at the instant that he
came upon the platform, that the fewer his words the
more loudly would the tiny, silent figure do its own soliciting.
And so it proved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please show the Belgian posters, Doctor Burns,&#8221;
Black suggested, and Red, taking them from Jane&#8217;s hands,
held them up one by one without comment. And one by
one they were bid off, while Black stood and held the baby
and looked on, his eyes eloquent of his interest. Bid off
at sums which ranged higher and higher, as the company,
now as ardent in the cause of the living, breathing baby
before them as they had been apathetic in that of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
small compatriots across the sea of whom they had only
heard, vied with each other to prove that they could be
generous when they really saw the reason why.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d certainly like a picture of Mr. Black and that baby
at this minute,&#8221; murmured Fanny Fitch in the ear of Nan
Lockhart, as she returned from a trip to the front of the
room, where she had recklessly emptied a gold mesh-bag
to buy that for which she did not care at all. She had
looked up into Robert Black&#8217;s face as she stood below him,
and had received one of those strictly impartial smiles
which he was now bestowing upon everybody who asked
for them; and she had come away thoroughly determined
to secure for herself, before much more time had passed,
a smile which should be purely personal.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does look dear with the baby,&#8221; admitted Nan,
heartily. &#8220;He holds him as if he had held babies all his
life. Oh, it&#8217;s splendid, the way things are going now.
How <i>was</i> he inspired to get that child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eye for the dramatic, my dear,&#8221; suggested her friend.
&#8220;All successful ministers have it. The unsuccessful ones
lack it, and go around wondering why their schemes fail.
It&#8217;s perfectly legitimate&mdash;and it makes them much more
interesting. The Reverend Robert looks as innocent as
the child in his arms, but he&#8217;s really a born actor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny Fitch! How ridiculous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he weren&#8217;t he would have rushed up there with the
baby and harangued us for fifteen minutes about the needs
of the Belgians. But he has the dramatic sense just to
stand there looking like a young father angel, with those
dark brows of his bent on the poor child, and we fall for
him like the idiots we are&mdash;as he knew we would. I never
dreamed of spending that last ten dollars. I didn&#8217;t spend
it for the Belgians at all. I spent it for Robert Black!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re frank enough to admit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use in trying to conceal anything from you,
Sharp Eyes?&#8221; And Miss Fitch returned to her occupation
of observing the events now transpiring up in front,
with a pair of lustrous eyes which missed no detail.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s receptacle for the money handed her was nearly
full now. It was a beautiful big bowl of Sheffield plate,
one of the best in her collection, and it had called forth
much admiring comment. Red sold his last poster&mdash;not
all were for sale. This last one was the great &#8220;man on
the horse,&#8221; galloping with sword upraised and mouth
shouting&mdash;the most vivid and striking of all, though to
the eye of the connoisseur worth far less than some of
quieter and more subtle suggestion. It was promptly
bid in by the rotund gentleman who had challenged Red
half an hour before, and he named so high a figure that
he had no contestants. He received his purchase with a
large gesture of triumph and pleasure with himself, and
Jane, accepting his check, written with a flourish, gave
him the expression of gratitude he had coveted.</p>

<p>She took the baby from Black, then, saying: &#8220;Your
poster&mdash;hasn&#8217;t the time come? Won&#8217;t you show it yourself,
please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to, if I may. But it&#8217;s not for sale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Then we have all we are to get to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. Yes&mdash;I think we have all we are to get&mdash;to-night.
But&mdash;perhaps we have something to give.&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t understand&mdash;how should she? She watched
him go back to the little platform, its boards covered with
a fine rug and its backing a piece of valuable French tapestry
above which hung the French and Belgian flags.
Jane had conceived this effective setting for her auctioneer,
but it was none the less effective for the man who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
taken Burns&#8217; place. Standing there he slowly unrolled
the poster, and the people before him ceased their buzzing
talk to watch, for something in his face told them that
here was that which they must not miss.</p>

<p>Ah, but this was an original! How had he procured it?
It was a strip of canvas which Black unrolled and silently
held up before the hundred pairs of gazing eyes. And as
they looked, the last whisper gave way to a stillness which
was its own commentary on and tribute to the story told
by an artist who was somehow different from the rest.</p>

<p>The colouring of the picture&mdash;it was a poster like the
others&mdash;was all rich blues and browns, with a hint of yellow
and one gleam of white. The background was a dim huddle
of ruins and battle smoke. Close in the foreground were
two figures&mdash;a stalwart British soldier in khaki and steel
hat supporting a wounded Frenchman in the &#8220;horizon
blue&#8221; of the French army, his bare head bandaged and
drooping upon his chest. These two figures alone were
infinitely touching, but that which gave the picture its
thrilling appeal was that at which the Briton, his hand at
the salute, was gazing over the bent head of his comrade.
And of that, at the extreme left of the picture, all that
one saw was a rough wooden post, and upon it, nailed to
it by the rigid feet, two still, naked limbs. A roadside
Calvary&mdash;or the suggestion of it&mdash;that was all one saw.
But the look in the saluting soldier&#8217;s rugged face was one
of awe&mdash;and adoration.</p>

<p>Black held the canvas for a long minute, his own grave
face turned toward it. Not even Fanny Fitch, in her
cynical young heart, could dare to accuse him of &#8220;acting&#8221;
now. The silence over the room was breathless&mdash;it was
the hush which tells its story unmistakably. Before it
could be broken, Black lowered the canvas.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It brought it home to me so
powerfully what is happening &#8216;over there&#8217;&mdash;I just wanted
you to see it, too. That&#8217;s where the gifts you have
given to-night are going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Black&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; It was Mr. Samuel Lockhart, speaking
in a low voice from the front&mdash;&#8220;is that&mdash;to be bought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is mine, Mr. Lockhart. It is not for sale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is wonderful,&#8221; said the elder man, with reverence.</p>

<p>Black rolled the canvas, and crossing the room put it
out of sight. When he came back a little crowd surrounded
the Belgian baby, in Jane&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>The assemblage took its leave with apparent reluctance.
In the suburban town there had been nothing just like
this evening in the memory of the oldest present. Those
who carried posters with them held them rather ostentatiously;
those who had none were explaining, some of
them, that they had not been able to secure the ones
they wanted, but that they had been happy to contribute
something to so worthy a fund.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite unique, and certainly very delightfully managed,&#8221;
one stout matron said to Jane as she extended a
cordial hand. &#8220;You had courage, my dear, to attempt
this here. You must have raised more than you could
have expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t counted it,&#8221; Jane answered. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a
happy thing to try to do it&mdash;I&#8217;m very grateful to you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the last had gone, except the five who had been
her helpers, she sat down with the Sheffield bowl in her
lap, and Red took his place beside her, to help her count.
Tom, having run home with the baby, was back again,
eagerly hanging over Red&#8217;s shoulder as he put bills of the
same denomination together, and sorted silver. The
other three looked on, eagerly awaiting the result.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Red announced the sum total&mdash;it was a goodly sum,
running well into the hundreds. He looked up at Black.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three fourths of that came in after you brought up
that blamed little beggar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the things
you didn&#8217;t say were what turned the trick! By George,
you taught me a lesson to-night. Speech may be silver,
but a silence like that of yours sure was golden. I didn&#8217;t
know any man of your profession understood it so well.
Hanged if I don&#8217;t keep my tongue between my teeth,
after this!&#8221;</p>

<p>A burst of appreciatively skeptical laughter from those
who knew him answered this. But Black, though he
smiled too, answered soberly: &#8220;There&#8217;s a time for everything.
You plowed&mdash;and the baby harrowed, that was
all. The Belgian fund reaps. I know we&#8217;re all mighty
happy about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he left, a few minutes later, Jane Ray gave him
the sort of handshake, with her firm young hand closing
with his in full reciprocity, which one man gives to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t thank you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was wonderfully
done. But&mdash;do you mind telling?&mdash;you must have held
many babies!&#8221;</p>

<p>How Black himself laughed then, his head thrown back,
his white teeth gleaming. &#8220;Being a woman, that&#8217;s what
you get out of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes&mdash;I&#8217;ve held every one
I could ever get hold of. I like them a bit bigger than
that&mdash;a regular armful. Poor &#8216;blamed little beggar&#8217;&mdash;as
the Doctor called him! But he&#8217;ll be an armful some day.
We&#8217;ll see to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet we will,&#8221; declared Tom, who had been lingering
to get away with Black. &#8220;Night, Miss Ray. I&#8217;ll be
around in the morning to help you move things back.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Don&#8217;t you touch a darned thing till I come. Promise! I
say, aren&#8217;t you grateful to me? I borrowed that baby,
and brought him here, too. The attention I attracted was
awful. I had about ten dozen street kids with me all
the way. Maybe that wasn&#8217;t just as useful a stunt as
standing up and saying things, under the Belgian flag&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sent him her most adorable look. &#8220;Mr. Tom,
you&#8217;re a trump. You have my deepest appreciation&mdash;and
good-night!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Tom, a minute later, when they were well
away, &#8220;I call her some girl. She&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s&mdash;well, she&#8217;s a
regular fellow&mdash;and you know how I mean that, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Black, looking fixedly up the street, as if
he saw there something which interested him very much.
&#8220;I know how you mean that. I think you are&mdash;right.
Tom, would you object to telling me what all those women
meant about my holding that baby? How on earth did
I hold it differently from the way any man would hold it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Young Mrs. Germain told me,&#8221; said Tom, chuckling
with glee, &#8220;that you held it in your left arm. They said
nobody except an old hand would do that. To have your
right free to do other things&mdash;see? I never understood
about that before. I carried the kid on my right arm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After this,&#8221; declared Robert McPherson Black, firmly,
&#8220;if I ever have occasion to hold an infant in public, I shall
do it with <i>my</i> right arm!&#8221;</p>

<small>RATHER A BIG THING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BLACK was standing in the vestibule of a train which
was bringing him back, at a late hour, from the city
where he had spent the day at a conference of clergymen.
He was somewhat weary, for the day had been filled with
long debate over a certain question which had seemed
to him vital indeed but not debatable. He had not hesitated
to say so, and had been delayed after the evening
session was over by men who still wanted to talk it out
interminably with him. He had missed his trolley and
had therefore taken the train.</p>

<p>As the train drew in Black found himself crowded next to
a young man who seemed to be suffering from an excessive
nervousness. He was tall and thin, rather handsome of
face, but with eyes so deeply shadowed that they suggested
extreme and recent illness. His manner was so
shaky, as he went down the steps ahead of Black, and
he set down his bag upon the platform with such a gesture
of supreme fatigue, that Black stopped to find out if
he were indeed ill, and if he needed help. At the same
moment the stranger looked round at him, and put a
question in a quick, breathless voice which indicated both
anxiety and difficulty at self-control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me,&#8221; he jerked out, &#8220;where Miss Ray&#8217;s
shop is&mdash;antique shop&mdash;Jane Ray? I ought to know&mdash;forgotten
the street.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Black hesitated. Send this unknown and unnatural
young man to Jane at this late hour? He looked both
dissipated and irresponsible, and Black thought he caught
the odour of alcohol upon his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s late. The shop will be closed,&#8221; Black suggested.
&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better go to a hotel to-night, and look it up
in the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger frowned, and answered irritably&mdash;almost
angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not. Miss Ray&#8217;s my sister. Will you
tell me where the shop is, or have I got to find somebody
who will?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black made a quick decision. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show you the way.
It&#8217;s not far out of my course.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes searched the stranger&#8217;s face, to find there confirmation
of the statement which otherwise he would not
have been inclined to believe. The resemblance, taking
into account the difference between Jane&#8217;s look of vitality
and radiant energy, and this young man&#8217;s whole aspect
of broken health and overwrought nerves, was very
apparent. And as the stranger looked down the platform,
and his profile was presented to Black&#8217;s scrutiny, he saw
that the same definite outlines of beauty and distinction
were there, not to be mistaken. On this basis he could
have no hesitation in guiding the markedly feeble footsteps
to her door, though he was wondering, rather anxiously,
just what his arrival, evidently unexpected by her,
would mean to her. Black had never heard anybody
mention her having a brother&mdash;he had understood she
was quite alone in the world.</p>

<p>The two set out down the street. The young
man walked so falteringly that after a minute Black
took his well-worn leather bag away from him, saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
pleasantly: &#8220;Let me carry it. You&#8217;re not quite fit, I&#8217;m
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other glowered. &#8220;Not fit! What do you mean
by that? I&#8217;m fit enough&mdash;I&#8217;m just worn out, that&#8217;s all.
Overwork&mdash;illness&mdash;nerves&mdash;I&#8217;m all in. But if you mean
to imply&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to imply anything, Mr. Ray&mdash;if that is
your name. I can see you have been ill. Let me put
my hand under your arm, won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;d call a cab
if there were any to be had&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid there aren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want a cab&mdash;can walk. Walk faster, that&#8217;s all.
I&#8217;m liable to go to pieces pretty soon&mdash;haven&#8217;t eaten a
mouthful to-day&mdash;couldn&#8217;t look at it. These confounded
nerves&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no doubt but his nerves were confounded, and
badly, at that. As they walked the few squares necessary
to get to Jane&#8217;s little street, Black felt his companion becoming
more and more desperately shaken in body and
mind. Several times he said something which struck
Black as all but irrational. More than once he would
have wavered far away from the straight course if Black&#8217;s
arm had not held him steady. A policeman looked sharply
at the pair as they passed under the light at a corner, and
Black was aware that but one inference was likely&mdash;one
he was not at all sure was untrue.</p>

<p>The shop was dark when they reached it, and Black
rang the bell. Just as a light appeared, and he saw
Jane coming through from her rooms in the rear, the
stranger suddenly sank against Black&#8217;s shoulder, and he
was forced to drop the bag and hold him supported in
both arms. So when Jane opened the door, it was to this
singular and somewhat startling apparition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened, Miss Ray,&#8221; said Black&#8217;s quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
assured voice. &#8220;He&#8217;s only faint, I think. This is&mdash;your
brother? He&#8217;s been ill, and wasn&#8217;t quite strong enough
to make the journey. We&#8217;ll get him lying down as fast
as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Cary!&#8221; Jane was out of the door in an instant,
and her strong young arm was around her brother from
the opposite side. &#8220;Can you walk, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hardly had to walk, so nearly did they carry him.
They had him through the shop and into the little living
room in no time at all, and Jane had run for a stimulant.
The glass she held to his lips and the prostrate position
revived him quickly. He made a wry face at the tumbler
she had set down upon a table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you do better than that?&#8221; he questioned, weakly.
&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake give me the real thing&mdash;I need it. I&#8217;m
dying for it&mdash;yes, dying literally, if you want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane shook her head. &#8220;No, dear&mdash;I haven&#8217;t any&mdash;and
I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t need it. I&#8217;ll make you some strong
tea. Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you came, Cary!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man seemed to try to smile&mdash;but the smile
looked more like tears. He held up a shaking hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nerves&mdash;Jane&mdash;nerves. I&#8217;m all in&mdash;I&#8217;m a wreck.
I&#8217;m&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His look wavered around at Black, who stood
above and behind him. &#8220;We&#8217;ll excuse you, sir,&#8221; he said,
with an effort at dignity. &#8220;I&#8217;m very much obliged to
you&mdash;and now&mdash;please go!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane looked up at Black with a face into which the quick
and lovely colour poured in a flood. &#8220;My brother isn&#8217;t
himself,&#8221; she said under her breath. &#8220;Do forgive him. I&#8217;m
so grateful to you. I can get on with him nicely now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can surely be of service to you yet, Miss Ray,&#8221;
Black said with decision. &#8220;Your brother needs care, and
I can help you make him comfortable.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>She shook her head. &#8220;I can do all he needs,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s late. I can&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then Cary Ray decided things for himself by sitting
up and pointing with a shaking finger and a voice of fright
toward a shadowy corner. &#8220;What&#8217;s that!&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that? You haven&#8217;t got &#8217;em here, too, have you?
I thought <i>you</i> wouldn&#8217;t have &#8217;em&mdash;not <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing in the corner. Black laid young Ray
gently but firmly down upon the couch again. &#8220;No,
you&#8217;re mistaken,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t got
them here&mdash;and we&#8217;re not going to have them. Trust me
for that&mdash;I know all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Across the dark head, again fallen weakly upon the
couch pillow, Black&#8217;s eyes met Jane&#8217;s. &#8220;Please let me
stay awhile?&#8221; he urged.</p>

<p>She knew then that he knew, and that it was of no use
to try to hide the pitiful, shameful thing from him. She
nodded and turned away, and he saw her clench one hand
tight as she went to Cary&#8217;s bag and opened it. He saw
her search through the bag, and take from it something
which he did not see, because she went out of the room
with it. She was gone some time. While she was away,
he occupied himself with keeping Cary&#8217;s attention from
concentrating on that corner of which his suspicions became
now and then acute.</p>

<p>When she returned, her brother was talking fast and
disconnectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t slept&mdash;&#8221; he was saying, in a tone that was
half a wail&mdash;&#8220;I haven&#8217;t slept for a week&mdash;haven&#8217;t had a
decent night&#8217;s sleep in months. I&mdash;&mdash; How can you expect&mdash;I
tell you a fellow can&#8217;t keep going&mdash;work&#8217;s all
gone to pot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane came close to him. &#8220;You shall stay here and rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
up, Cary,&#8221; she said gently, with her hand on his hot head.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll feed you wonderfully and get you strong again.
Could you take just a little something now?&mdash;A glass of
milk&mdash;a tiny sandwich&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head, with a gesture of distaste. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
say food to me&mdash;don&#8217;t bring any in my sight. There&#8217;s
just one thing I want&mdash;and I know you won&#8217;t give it to
me. Jane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he caught at her hand&mdash;&#8220;it would make me
sleep, and God knows I need that&mdash;I shall die without it.
I&mdash;that thing in the corner&mdash;oh, I didn&#8217;t think it would
track me here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t here. Forget it!&#8221; Black spoke sternly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re going to bed, and to sleep&mdash;I&#8217;m going to see to
that. Miss Ray&mdash;you&#8217;ll let me get your brother into his
bed, won&#8217;t you? Once there, I&#8217;ll put him to sleep&mdash;I
know I can&mdash;and that&#8217;s what he needs more than anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and make his room ready,&#8221; said Jane Ray.
She had to yield. She knew Cary needed a man&#8217;s
hand, a man&#8217;s will. Strong and resourceful though she
was, she understood that at this pass no woman could
control the disordered nerves as a man could. She could
only be thankful that she had this man at her service at
this hour, though perhaps he was the last man she would
have picked out, or have been willing to have know of her
unhappy situation. But he knew it now, and somehow,
as her eyes met his, she could not be quite sorry, after all,
that it was he who was to help her. At least, whether he
could deal with Cary or not, she could be absolutely sure
that she could trust him. And this was not because of his
profession&mdash;rather, to Jane, it was in spite of it.</p>

<p>So, presently, Black found himself putting Cary Ray
to bed&mdash;in a room he didn&#8217;t in the least deserve to have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
for it was unquestionably Jane&#8217;s own. Every detail of its
furnishing told him that, though he did not allow himself
to study it much from this point of view. It was rather a
large room, and as simply outfitted as could be imagined,
and yet somehow its whole aspect gave the impression
of character and charm. And Black had never in his life
hated to see a man installed in a place which didn&#8217;t belong
to him as he hated to see Cary Ray made comfortable
in this exquisitely chaste room of Jane&#8217;s. Yet he couldn&#8217;t
very well protest. He knew as well as if he had been told
that it was the only room of adequate size and comfort
which she had to put at her brother&#8217;s service, and that,
since he was ill and in need, she wouldn&#8217;t dream of tucking
him up on a couch somewhere as a substitute. For one
bad moment Black was astonished to discover that he was
longing to pitch this dissipated young man out of the
house, and tell his sister to keep her white sheets clean
from his contaminated body.</p>

<p>But then, of course, he settled to his task, sternly putting
such thoughts away from him. Having got Cary stretched
between those same sheets, the lights extinguished&mdash;except
that from an amber-shaded reading light beside the bed&mdash;instead
of taking a chair he sat down on the foot of the bed
in a friendly sort of way, and remarked in the most matter-of-fact
tone in the world&mdash;&#8220;This reminds me of a night I
spent once down in Virginia&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And from that he
was off, by degrees, and not at all as if he had set himself
to entertain his patient, into a recital that presently captured
Cary&#8217;s hitherto fitful attention and held it until
the sense of strangeness in the whole situation had somewhat
gone by for the invalid&mdash;if not for the nurse.</p>

<p>The night was not spent, however, in telling stories.
It is true that Cary himself told one or two&mdash;and lurid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
tales they were, with more than a suspicion of nightmare
in them, the nightmare of drugs or of a disordered brain.
There were intervals&mdash;though few of them&mdash;when the
young man sank into a brief sleep, as if from profound
exhaustion, but he invariably awoke with a start and a
cry to a condition which became, as the hours went on,
more and more difficult to control. Black did succeed
in controlling it, by sheer force of will; he seemed to have
a peculiar power to do this. His hand upon Cary&#8217;s, his
voice in his ear, and time and again the strained nerves
and muscles would relax, and the crisis would pass. But
more than once, so wild was the almost delirium of the
sufferer, that it took all Black&#8217;s physical strength to keep
command.</p>

<p>Jane was there only a part of the time. It was during
the periods of repose and half slumber that she would
slip noiselessly into the room, stand watching her brother
silently, or sit down upon the foot of the bed opposite
Black, to look at the thin face on the pillow with her unhappy
heart in her eyes. Black had never seen much of
Jane&#8217;s heart before; he couldn&#8217;t help seeing something of
it now. It was beyond his power to refrain, now and then,
as the two sat in the hush of the night, so strangely thrown
together in a situation which neither could ever have
foreseen, from looking across at Jane&#8217;s clear-cut profile
in the subdued light, and studying it as if he had never
seen it before. His pity for her grew as the hours went
by, and with his pity a tenderness grew also, until, quite
suddenly, he was startled by a consciousness that he
wanted to go around to her and take her hands in his and
tell her&mdash;that he would stand by her to the last limit of his
power.</p>

<p>On one of her trips into the room, when Cary happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
to be quiet for a little, Jane whispered to Black that she
would take his place and he must go downstairs and eat
the lunch she had prepared for him. When he told her
that he didn&#8217;t need it she only pointed, quite imperiously,
to the door, and he obediently left the room and went
to do her bidding. It was as he was finishing the delicious
viands he found on the table in the room below that his
ear, alert for any signs of trouble above, caught the sinister
sound he was listening for. He ran up, three steps at
a time, to find Jane struggling in the grip of her half-crazed
brother, who was demanding in language so profane
that it seemed to burn the air, the instant production of
the one thing in the world he wanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it&mdash;you&#8217;re hiding it&mdash;you little fool! Do
you want to see me dead before morning&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Then came the oaths, this time but half uttered before a
strong, smothering hand descended upon the twisting
mouth, and a stern voice said commandingly: &#8220;Not another
word like that, Ray, or I&#8217;ll choke you till you&#8217;re
still!&#8221; At the same moment a jerk of Black&#8217;s head toward
the door and his fiery glance at Jane told her that he
wanted her out of the room and out of hearing as fast as
she could get away.</p>

<p>It was a long tussle this time, but it was over at last, and
once more, worn out by the violence of his own efforts,
Cary lay quiet for a little. Confident that though not
asleep he would not at once find strength to fight again,
Black stole out of the room. In the narrow hall outside
he found Jane, sitting on the top stair, her head buried in
her arms.</p>

<p>Thus far he had known Jane only as a finely practical
young business woman, as independent as she was capable.
He had seen that adorable head of hers, with its smooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
crown of chestnut hair, always held high, with a suggestion
of indomitable courage. Now&mdash;it looked as if it had
been brought low&mdash;incredibly low. She had long before
exchanged the dress in which she had spent the day in
the shop for a plain white skirt and blouse such as nurses
wear, and in this costume she looked much younger and
more girlish than in the more conventional dress. Her
white-shod feet were crossed as a girl crosses them; and
altogether, in the dim light from the half-open door, she
seemed to Black more like Cary&#8217;s dependent young sister
than one older than himself to whom he had come as to a
refuge. He didn&#8217;t know, as yet, that after all it was Cary
who was the older.</p>

<p>At the sound of the light footstep, however, Jane instantly
lifted her head, and then rose quickly to her feet,
and he saw her smile&mdash;an undoubtedly forced little smile,
but full of pluck.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be desperately tired,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;But
I don&#8217;t know what I should have done without you this
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have done without me. I can&#8217;t tell you
how glad I am to be here. And I&#8217;m not half as tired as
you are. Won&#8217;t you go now and lie down? You can&#8217;t
do a bit of good by staying on guard here, and you&#8217;ll need
your strength to-morrow. This isn&#8217;t going to be a short
siege, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s not. But I&#8217;ve been through it all before.
I shall call Doctor Burns to-morrow. I tried to to-night,
so I could release you, but he was away for the night.
And&mdash;I didn&#8217;t want to call anybody else. Nobody else&mdash;here&mdash;knows,
and&mdash;I can&#8217;t have them know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody knows you have a brother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;ve seen Cary&mdash;but only when he was&mdash;himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
He is&mdash;Cary is a genius, Mr. Black; he just has&mdash;the
defects of his temperament. He&mdash;I can show you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly and unexpectedly, the tears
leaped into her eyes. Like a small boy, abashed at having
shown emotion, she threw back her head, smiling again,
and drawing the back of her hand across the tell-tale eyes.
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m ashamed of myself,&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;Believe
me, I&#8217;m not so weak as this looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not in the least weak. And it&#8217;s three o&#8217;clock
in the morning, the hour when things take hold. See
here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And he looked her straight in the eyes.
&#8220;Jane Ray,&#8221; he said, not too gently, but as a man might
say it to a man, though he spoke low, on account of that
open door&mdash;&#8220;I want you to know that, whatever comes,
I&#8217;ll see you through. I won&#8217;t add&mdash;&#8216;if you&#8217;ll let me&#8217;&mdash;for
you&#8217;re going to let me. You can&#8217;t help it&mdash;after to-night.&#8221;
And he held out his hand. &#8220;Shall we make a
pledge of it?&#8221; he added, smiling gravely.</p>

<p>She looked straight back at him. &#8220;You can&#8217;t&mdash;see me
through,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&mdash;I&#8217;ve no claim on you. You
have your church&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have. Is that a reason why I can&#8217;t stand by you?
If it is&mdash;it&#8217;s not the church I gave myself to. And&mdash;I
think you need another brother. I&#8217;m sure Cary does.&#8221;
His hand was waiting. He looked down at it. &#8220;Are
you going to make me take it back?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;That
would&mdash;feel very strange. I didn&#8217;t offer it&mdash;to take
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her own into it then. He gave it a long, strong
clasp and let it go. Without looking at him she turned
and ran downstairs, and he went back into the room where
Cary was beginning to stir restlessly again.</p>

<p>He was conscious, in every fibre, that something had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
happened to him. He had not had the least idea, when
he had begun his vigils that night, that before morning
he should be thrilled as he never had been thrilled
before, by a simple handclasp, and a few spoken words,
offering only what he had offered many a man or woman in
trouble before now, his sympathy and help. But somehow&mdash;this
had been different. He was acutely aware that
the wish to see Jane Ray through whatever difficulties
and problems might lie before her in connection with this
brother of hers was a mighty different sort of wish from
any that he had experienced before. And the fact that
she had tacitly accepted his help&mdash;proud Jane&mdash;for he
knew she was proud&mdash;gave him a satisfaction out of all
proportion to any ordinary significance attached to so
obvious and natural a suggestion. There was now a
bond between them&mdash;that was the thing that took hold
of him; a bond which made possible&mdash;well, what did it
make possible? What did he want it to make possible?
He didn&#8217;t try to go into that. One thing was sure: he had,
by an accident, come into her life in a way he had never
dreamed of, and once in&mdash;he wanted to stay. This touch
of intimate comradeship had been something new in his
experience. It might never happen again; certainly he
could not continue to take care of Cary Ray through
nights such as this one had been. Doubtless Doctor
Burns, once called, would take care of that; Black knew
that under the proper treatment the following night might
be one of comparative calm. But he could come to see
him often; could cultivate his friendship&mdash;gain as much
influence over him as possible. And if others found out
about it, criticized him for giving time and thought to
people outside his parish&mdash;well&mdash;they might. Black&#8217;s
decision on this head was one which brooked no interference.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
Where he could help he would help, in his parish or
out of it....</p>

<p>It was at five o&#8217;clock in the morning that he fell asleep.
He had not meant to go to sleep, and had been caught
unawares. For an hour Cary had been quiet. Black,
sitting on the edge of his bed, had found a new way to
keep hold of his man&mdash;and that was by keeping hold of
him literally. In a moment of desperation he had seized
the thin, restless fingers and forced them to remain
still in his own. The firm contact had produced a remarkable
effect. After a little Cary&#8217;s hand had laid hold of
Black&#8217;s and clung to it, while the invalid himself had sunk
almost immediately away into something more resembling
real slumber than anything in the past night. Finding
this expedient so successful Black had allowed it to continue,
for each time he tried to release himself Cary took
a fresh grip, like a child who will not let go his hold upon
his mother, even in unconsciousness. Finally, Black had
made himself as comfortable as he could by slipping down
upon the floor, where he could rest his head upon the bed
without withdrawing his hand. And in this posture, one
eloquent of his own fatigue from the long vigil, he went
soundly to sleep.</p>

<p>So when, with the approach of daylight, Jane came in
to tell her assistant that he must go home now, while the
streets were empty of observant eyes, she found what she
had not expected. She stood looking at the two figures
the one stretched so comfortably in the bed, the other
propped in so strained an attitude outside of it. As she
looked something very womanly and beautiful came into
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible&mdash;&#8221; this was her thought&mdash;&#8220;that <i>you</i>
have done this&mdash;for <i>me</i>? I didn&#8217;t know men of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
profession ever did things like this. But if I had known
any of them ever did, I should have known it would be
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked like a tall and fine-featured boy as he slept
in his twisted position, did Robert McPherson Black.
He had taken off his coat while he wrestled with Cary,
and the white shirt-sleeves rolled to the elbows, showing
a sinewy forearm, added to the boyish effect. Suddenly
Jane&#8217;s eyes caught sight of something on one bare arm
which made her stoop lower, and then flush with chagrin.
It was the unmistakable mark upon the fair flesh of gripping
fingers with nails which had torn&mdash;already turning
dark, as such deep bruises do. It was a little thing
enough&mdash;Jane knew already how her new friend would
make light of it if she mentioned it&mdash;and yet somehow it was
rather a big thing, too. It gave emphasis to the service
he had done her; how could she have dealt, alone, with
wild brutality like that?</p>

<p>Then, as she looked, Cary roused, turned, opened his
eyes, withdrew his hand with a jerk, and Black woke also.
And Cary was sane again, and very weak, and spoke
querulously:</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began. &#8220;Who are you&mdash;and
what are you doing here?&#8221; Then, to Jane,&mdash;&#8220;Is this a
cheap lodging house, and do you take in every vagrant
that comes along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I took you in, dear,&#8221; said Jane, quietly. &#8220;And Mr.
Black has stayed by you all night. He must be very
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had quite a sleep, anyhow,&#8221; he
said, attempting with considerable difficulty to get upon
his feet. &#8220;Certain areas seem to have been more asleep
than others, though. My arm&mdash;&#8221; and he began to pinch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and pound it&mdash;&#8220;looks to be all here, but it feels rather absent.&#8221;
It was absent indeed, and hanging by his side, quite
numb.</p>

<p>Cary&#8217;s eyes widened. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;why, you&#8217;re the
chap that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His weak voice took on a tension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about the identification. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re
feeling better this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel better. I feet like the devil. But I&mdash;I&#8217;m
certainly obliged to you. I&mdash;have you been here all&mdash;night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Oh, thank you, Miss Ray&mdash;it&#8217;ll come back
in a minute,&#8221; for Jane had come up and was applying a
vigorous massage with her own hands to the inert arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; but Cary left the exclamation unfinished,
and began another. &#8220;I say&mdash;I&#8217;m not worth it!&#8221; he
groaned, and buried his head in the crumpled white pillow.</p>

<p>Downstairs, presently, Black, ready to go, spoke authoritatively.
&#8220;Please promise me you will call the Doctor
early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; Jane agreed. &#8220;He has seen Cary before. If
I could only have had him last night, and spared you&mdash;I
shouldn&#8217;t feel so guilty this morning. Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and
at this moment, for the first time, a recognition came to
her. It left her a little stunned. &#8220;Mr. Black,&#8221; she said,
unhappily, &#8220;I&#8217;m just realizing what day this is. It&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s Sunday,&#8221; admitted Black, smiling, &#8220;And
none the worse for that, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;you have to preach&mdash;and you&#8217;ve been up all
night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a Scot, but&mdash;I&#8217;ve seldom
left my sermons till Saturday and Sunday to prepare.
I&#8217;m all armed and equipped, Miss Ray&mdash;you&#8217;ve nothing
to regret.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t slept&mdash;you&#8217;re frightfully tired&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I look as haggard as that? If I do, it&#8217;s only because
I need a clean shave. Come&mdash;if you weren&#8217;t tied
up I&#8217;d challenge you to go to church and see if I can&#8217;t hit
from the shoulder, in spite of my lusty right arm&#8217;s getting
numb for ten minutes in your service. Good-by, for the
present, Miss Ray. I shall call you up, later, to learn if
the Doctor&#8217;s been here. And I shall&mdash;make friends with
your brother the very best I know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked straight down into her uplifted eyes as he
shook hands&mdash;with no lingering or extra pressure this
time, just the hard, comradely grasp it was his nature to
give. Then he was gone, out into the early morning twilight,
without a glance to right or left to see if any saw him
go.</p>

<p>An hour later Red came in, looked the situation over,
and commented brusquely:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have had a&mdash;an Inferno&mdash;of a night with
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t&mdash;because I wasn&#8217;t alone. Mr. Black stayed
all night and took care of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; The quick question spoke incredulity. Red
stared at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;He brought Cary from the station, and then stayed&mdash;because&mdash;he
thought he was needed. I don&#8217;t know quite
what I should have done without him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red whistled. &#8220;You bet you don&#8217;t. Well, well&mdash;the
minister certainly is game. Didn&#8217;t worry about what
some old lady of the parish might think, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane drew herself up. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that, Doctor
Burns.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mean that. There was
every reason why he should ignore any such possibility&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
understand the situation exactly. But I think it was
rather game of him, just the same. A case like Cary&#8217;s
isn&#8217;t exactly a joke to take care of, and the average outsider
gets out from under&mdash;and sends flowers to show his
sympathy&mdash;or a bottle of whisky, according to his lights.
Well&mdash;to go back to this precious brother of yours&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the right adjective,&#8221; said Jane Ray, steadily.
&#8220;You know perfectly well, Doctor Burns, he&#8217;s all I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221; He returned the look. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll do
my best to put him on his feet again. But he needs something
neither you nor I can give him. I&#8217;m inclined to
think&mdash;and this is something of a concession for me to
make, Jane&mdash;I&#8217;m inclined to think Robert Black could.
Cary&#8217;s a dreamer&mdash;and a weak one. Bob Black&#8217;s a
dreamer&mdash;but a strong one. If he could get Cary to&mdash;well&mdash;to
dream the right sort of dream&mdash;&mdash; You see, it&#8217;s a
case where a knowledge of psychology might take a hand
where a knowledge of pathology falls down. Do you get
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I do. You want me to&mdash;encourage an acquaintance
between them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I mean. I know you&#8217;re no church-goer,
my dear&mdash;and I admit I&#8217;ve never been much of a one
myself. I feel a bit differently of late&mdash;perhaps you can
guess why. If you could get Cary under the influence
of this man Black&mdash;a friendship between them might
do the trick. Anyhow, don&#8217;t lay any stones in the way
out of fear of putting yourself under obligations to
Black. I&#8217;ve discovered that he&#8217;s happiest when he&#8217;s
doing some absolutely impossible thing for somebody
to whom he&#8217;s under no obligation to do it. People take
advantage of a disposition like that&mdash;but he can&#8217;t exactly
be trampled on, either&mdash;so you&#8217;re pretty safe. Now&mdash;to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
come down to brass tacks&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And he fell to giving her
precise directions as to the line of treatment he wished carried
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll sleep to-night,&#8221; he prophesied. &#8220;He&#8217;s got to.
I&#8217;ll come around this evening and put him under for you.
Good-bye for now, and remember I&#8217;m on the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was feeling, as she went back to her difficult task,
more hopeful about Cary than she had ever felt hitherto.
Well she might. She had now enlisted in his behalf the
whole power of a reconstructing force of which until now
she had hardly recognized the existence.</p>

<small>SPENDTHRIFTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ROBERT BLACK was dressing for the day. This
procedure, simple and commonplace enough in the
schedule of the ordinary man, was for him usually a somewhat
complicated process. The reason for this was that
he was apt to be, as to-day, attempting at the same time
to finish the reading from some left-over chapter of the
book he had been devouring the last thing before he went
to bed. Of course he could neither take his cold tub nor
shave his always darkening chin while perusing the latest
addition to his rapidly growing library. But the moment
these activities were over, he could and did don his attire
for the day while engaged in scanning the printed page
propped upon the chest of drawers before him. The result
of this economy of time was that he seldom actually heard
the bell ring to summon him to his breakfast, and was
accustomed to appear in the dining-room doorway, book
in one hand, morning paper just gathered in from the
doorstep in the other, and to find there Mrs. Hodder
awaiting him in a grieved silence. He would then offer
her a smiling apology, upon which she would shake her
head over the incomprehensible ways of men who thought
more of the feeding of brains than body, and proceed devotedly
to serve him with food kept hot for his coming.</p>

<p>On this particular morning Black, strolling in as usual,
book under his arm, newspaper stretched before him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
eagerly snatching at the headlines always big with war
news these days, paused to finish a long paragraph, at the
same time saying cheerfully, &#8220;Good morning, Mrs. Hodder.
Late again, am I? Sorry! Afraid I&#8217;m hopeless.
But&mdash;listen to this:&#8221; The paragraph finished, he
looked up, emphatic comment on his lips. It died there
even as it was born, for the room was empty, the table
unset, the curtains at the windows undrawn. In brief, no
breakfast was awaiting the minister this morning, and
there was no possible explanation visible.</p>

<p>Black may have been an incorrigible student; he was
also unquestionably a man of action. He threw book and
paper upon the table and ascended the back stairs in long
leaps. Had Mrs. Hodder overslept? It was inconceivable.
The only other logical supposition then was that
she was ill. If she were ill&mdash;and alone&mdash;of course he
couldn&#8217;t get to her too soon&mdash;hence the leaps. She must
be very ill indeed to keep her from preparing the breakfast
which, he had discovered, was to her, in the manse,
nothing less than a rite.</p>

<p>He knocked upon her door. An unhappy voice instantly
replied: &#8220;Open the door&mdash;just a crack&mdash;Mr.
Black, and I&#8217;ll tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door the required crack, and the explanation
issued, in unmistakable accents of suffering:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried my best to get down, I did indeed, Mr. Black.
But the truth is I can&#8217;t move. No&mdash;no&mdash;&#8221; at an exclamation
from outside the door denoting sympathy and alarm&mdash;&#8220;I
haven&#8217;t got a stroke nor anything like that. It&#8217;s nothing
more nor less than the lumbago, and I&#8217;m humiliated to
death to think I got such a thing. I&#8217;m subject to it, and
that&#8217;s the truth, and I never know when it&#8217;ll ketch me,
but I haven&#8217;t had a touch of it since I&#8217;ve been with you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
I begun to think there was something about the manse&mdash;and
doing for a minister, maybe&mdash;that kept it away. But&mdash;it&#8217;s
caught me good this time, and I don&#8217;t know what
you&#8217;ll do for your breakfast. I think maybe you&#8217;d better
go over to the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here Black interrupted her. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get my own
breakfast,&#8221; he announced firmly, &#8220;and yours, too. Stay
perfectly quiet till I bring you up a tray. After that we&#8217;ll
have the doctor in to see you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his turn. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any
doctor. Doctors can&#8217;t do a thing for lumbago&mdash;except
tell you you got chilled or something, and to keep still
and rest up. When the pain goes it goes, and you can&#8217;t
tell when. Maybe &#8217;long about noon I can get downstairs.
I don&#8217;t want any breakfast, and if you&#8217;ll go over to the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to the hotel, Mrs. Hodder&mdash;and you&#8217;re
not going without your breakfast. I will&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t cook!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can cook enough to keep us from starving. Now,
lie still and I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know where a thing is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>A groan issued from the hidden bed. &#8220;I never knew
a man that could. Listen here, Mr. Black. Now the
coffee&#8217;s in the closet up above the kitchen table, the third
door from the right. It&#8217;s in the same can it comes in,
but it ain&#8217;t ground, and the grinder&#8217;s in the pantry,
fastened to the wall. There may be some basins piled in
front of it&mdash;I don&#8217;t remember&mdash;likely they is. The
cream&#8217;s in the ice-chest&mdash;and <i>don&#8217;t</i> skim the first pan you
come to, because that&#8217;s night&#8217;s milk. You want to skim
yesterday morning&#8217;s pan, and that&#8217;s pushed back farther.
Now the bread-box&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;I know where that is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The oatmeal&#8217;s in the double-boiler&mdash;all you have to do
is to set it front of the stove, and make sure the water
ain&#8217;t all boiled away. Lucky I always cook <i>that</i> the night
before. I suppose you don&#8217;t know how to light the gas
in the broiler, so you can toast your bread. It&#8217;s the third
knob to the left&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Black got away at last, further instructions following
him by the air line, in spite of his shouted assurance that
he could find everything and do everything, and that his
housekeeper should rest comfortably and stop worrying.
It must be confessed, however, that he was worrying a
bit himself, for his first thought that he would make a
breakfast of oatmeal&mdash;since that was already cooked&mdash;and
let it go at that, was instantly followed by the recollection
that Mrs. Hodder didn&#8217;t eat oatmeal herself, but relied
principally upon the toast and coffee and boiled egg he
himself was accustomed to take with her. Unquestionably
she must have these, and it was up to him to prepare
them.</p>

<p>He removed his coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and
went at it. He lighted the gas and moved the double-boiler
forward, thus assuring himself of one staple article
upon the breakfast schedule. He then began a search for
the coffee, congratulating himself upon remembering that
the filtered beverage with which he was accustomed to be
served took time to make. Thus began the tragic hour
which followed....</p>

<p>Three quarters of an hour later young Tom Lockwood
came to the manse door and rang the bell. Black paused,
halfway between stove and pantry, then turned back
to the stove, because his sense of smell told him unmistakably
that something fatally wrong was occurring there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
He tried to diagnose the case in a hurry, failed, and hastened
unwillingly through the house to the door, wondering
just how flushed and upset he looked. He felt both to an
extreme degree. Absolutely nothing seemed to be going
right with that breakfast.</p>

<p>Tom came in, in his customary breezy way. &#8220;Morning!
Thought I&#8217;d drop in and see if you didn&#8217;t want to run
up on the hills to-day, same as you said a while back,
when we both had a morning to spare.&#8221; He paused,
surveying his host with an observant eye. &#8220;Anything
the matter, Mr. Black? Haven&#8217;t had&mdash;bad news, or
anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black smiled. &#8220;Do I look as despondent as that? No,
no&mdash;everything&#8217;s all right, thank you. But I&#8217;m afraid
I can&#8217;t get away this morning to go with you. My housekeeper&#8217;s
not very well. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here.&#8221; Tom eyed a black mark on the minister&#8217;s
forehead, and noted the rolled-up shirt-sleeves. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not&mdash;trying to get breakfast, are you? I say&mdash;I&#8217;ll bet
that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing. If you are, let me help. I can
make dandy coffee.&#8221; Suddenly he sniffed the air. &#8220;Something&#8217;s
burning!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two ran back to the kitchen, making a race of it.
Black won, his nostrils full now of a metallic odour. He
dashed up to the stove where a double-boiler was protesting
that its lower section had long since boiled dry and
was being ruined, and hastily removed it. He gazed at it
ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me to look out for it,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some little cook, you are!&#8221; Tom, hands in pockets,
surveyed a saucepan in which two eggs were boiling violently,
fragments of white issuing from cracked shells.
&#8220;Busted &#8217;em when you put &#8217;em in, didn&#8217;t you? How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
long have they been at it&mdash;or isn&#8217;t there any time limit to
the way you like your eggs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black snatched the saucepan off. &#8220;I think I must have
put them on some twenty minutes ago. You see, the
toast distracted my mind.&#8221; He set down the saucepan
and hurriedly wrenched open the door of the broiler.
&#8220;Oh&mdash;thunder!&#8221; he exploded. Blackened ruins were all
that met the eye.</p>

<p>Tom leaned against a table, exploding joyously. &#8220;Want
me to say it for you?&#8221; he offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; Black&#8217;s jaw was now set grimly. &#8220;I
wonder if there&#8217;s any fool thing I haven&#8217;t done&mdash;or failed
to do. Anyhow, the coffee&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom got ahead of him at that, lifted the pot, turned up
the lid, estimated the contents of the upper container, and
shook his head. &#8220;The brew will be somewhat pale, methinks,&#8221;
was his comment. &#8220;I say, Mr. Black, you&#8217;re
no camper, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never had the chance. And never spent an hour
learning to cook. I&#8217;m awfully humiliated, but that doesn&#8217;t
help it any. It did seem simple&mdash;to boil an egg and make
a slice of toast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t&mdash;it&#8217;s darned complicated. Oatmeal and coffee
make the scheme horribly intricate, too. I know all about
it. I&#8217;ve leaped around between two campfires and frizzled
my bacon to death while I rescued my coffee, and knocked
over my coffee pot while I fished up the little scraps of bacon
from the bottom of the frying-pan. Here&mdash;I&#8217;ll fix the
coffee. Start some more toast, and we&#8217;ll hash up that
hard-boiled-egg effect to lay on top, and pretend we meant
it that way from the first. Along towards noon we&#8217;ll have
that tray ready for the lady upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, you&#8217;re a man and a brother. But I&#8217;m going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
send you off and see this thing through alone if it takes all
day.&#8221; And Black pushed him gently but firmly toward
the door. Tom, laughing, found it no use to resist. He
paused to lay an appraising hand on the bare forearm
which was showing such unexpected strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some muscle, I&#8217;ll say. Nobody&#8217;d guess it under that
clerical coat-sleeve. Look here&mdash;you&#8217;ll come over to
dinner to-night, and get a square meal? Mother&#8217;ll be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, if you so much as mention the situation here I&#8217;ll
make you pay dearly&mdash;see if I don&#8217;t! We&#8217;re all right.
I&#8217;ll never make these same mistakes again. If Mrs.
Hodder isn&#8217;t down by night I&#8217;ll buy a tin of baked beans.
Promise you won&#8217;t give me away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, all right. You can trust me. But I
don&#8217;t see why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do&mdash;and that&#8217;s enough. Good-bye, Tom.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went through the hall arm in arm, parted at the
door, and Tom ran back to his car. &#8220;You&#8217;re some Scotchman,
Robert Black,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;But I wish
you&#8217;d let me make that coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was nine-thirty by the kitchen clock when Mrs.
Hodder received her breakfast tray. She had managed,
smotheredly groaning, to don a wrapper, and to comb her
iron-gray locks, so that according to her ideas of propriety
she might decently admit her employer to her rigidly neat
apartment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m terrible sorry to make you all this trouble, Mr.
Black,&#8221; she said. &#8220;My, it&#8217;s wonderful how you&#8217;ve done
all this.&#8221; And she eyed the little tray with its cup of
steaming coffee, now a deep black in hue, its two slices of
curling but unburned toast, and its opened egg.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s rather wonderful myself,&#8221; the minister
conceded. Moisture stood upon his brow; his right wrist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
showed a red mark as of a burn; but his look was triumphant.
&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy it. And I&#8217;ve asked Doctor
Burns to look in, on his rounds, and fix you up. If he says
you should have a nurse we&#8217;ll have one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the doctor, and I won&#8217;t have a nurse&mdash;for
the lumbago; I&#8217;d feel like a fool. All that worries me
is how you&#8217;ll manage till I can get round. You ain&#8217;t used
to doin&#8217; for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done for myself in most ways ever since I came
over from Scotland, a boy of sixteen. Come, eat your
egg, Mrs. Hodder. I&#8217;ll be back for the tray soon. Let
me put another pillow behind your back&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He would wait on her, she couldn&#8217;t help it, and it must
be admitted she rather enjoyed it, in spite of the pain that
caught her afresh with every smallest move. It was like
having a nice son to look after her, she thought. She
submitted to his edict that she was to trust him to run the
house in her absence from the kitchen, and if she had her
doubts as to how he would accomplish this, they gave way
before the decision in his tone.</p>

<p>It was three days after this that Red, coming in at five
in the afternoon, to take a look at Mrs. Hodder, whom he
had been obliged to neglect since his first visit in a pressure
of work for sicker patients, discovered Black in the midst
of his new activities. The minister was hurriedly sweeping
and dusting his study, having rushed home from a
round of calls at the recollection that a committee meeting,
which included three women, was to be held there that
evening. Mrs. Hodder was accustomed to keep the room
in careful order; he himself had been throwing things
about it for three days now,&mdash;and undusted black walnut
desks and other dark furniture certainly do show neglect
in a fashion peculiarly unreserved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; Red paused in the study door. &#8220;I
knew you were a man of action, but I didn&#8217;t know it extended
this far. Can&#8217;t anybody be found to bridge the
chasm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anybody, thanks. A little exercise won&#8217;t
hurt me. Will you stop a minute? I&#8217;ll dust that leather
chair for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>To his surprise Red moved over to the chair and sat
down on the arm of it. &#8220;You look a trifle weary,&#8221; he
observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the dirt on my face. I swept the room with
violence&mdash;it needed it. Most of the dust settled on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They should equip the manse with a vacuum cleaner.
Been rather busy to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhat. Have you?&#8221; Black&#8217;s glance said that in
both cases the fact went without saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard of you in a place or two&mdash;been on your trail
more or less all day, as it happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume so. This is my day for calling at the
hospital. It struck me I was on <i>your</i> trail, Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sort of vicious circle? If you feel as vicious as I do
after it, you&#8217;re ready for anything. What do you say to a
camp supper in the woods to-night&mdash;instead of tinned
beans?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were two items in this speech which arrested
Black&#8217;s attention. He stopped dusting. &#8220;What do you
know about tinned beans?&#8221; he inquired, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom has no use for &#8217;em,&#8221; was the innocent reply.
&#8220;Never mind&mdash;he didn&#8217;t tell anybody but me. I&#8217;ve been
having things rather thick myself lately, and just now&mdash;well,
I feel like taking to the tall timber. Want to go with
me? The woods are rather nice&mdash;on a dry winter night
like this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it literally&mdash;a camp supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, man, where were you brought up? I
thought you were a country boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am&mdash;of the South country&mdash;Scotland first&mdash;the
States second. But I never went camping in my life. I
never had time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Till this week?&#8221; Red&#8217;s eyes twinkled enjoyingly.
&#8220;You can make coffee by now, I&#8217;ll wager. But you can&#8217;t
touch me at making it. Put on your collar and come along.
I&#8217;ll treat you to a new experience, and by the look of you,
you need it. So do I&mdash;we&#8217;ll clear out together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave Mrs. Hodder without her supper&mdash;and
I have a committee meeting at eight. I&#8217;m mighty sorry,
Doctor&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be. I&#8217;ll fix the whole thing, and have
you back in time for the bunch. Come&mdash;take orders from
me, for once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Black never had wanted to do anything in his
life as he wanted to accept this extraordinary and most
unprecedented invitation from the red-headed doctor
whom he could not yet call his friend. The high barriers
were down between them, there could be no doubt of that.
Red no longer avoided the minister; he came to church
now and then; the two met here and there with entire
friendliness, and had more than once consulted each other
on matters of mutual interest. But Red, except as he had
taken Black into his car when passing him upon the road,
had never directly sought him out on what looked like a
basis of real pleasure in his society. And now, when Red,
running upstairs to see Mrs. Hodder, and coming down
to announce that all she wanted for supper was a little tea
and bread and butter, and that it was up to Black to fix
up a tray in a hurry and be ready when he, Red, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
get back&mdash;in about fifteen minutes&mdash;well, Black was
pretty glad to give in, cast his broom and dust cloth into
the kitchen closet, wash his hands, and put a little water
to boil in the bottom of the kettle over a gas flame turned
up so high that it was warranted to have the water bubbling
in a jiffy!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, you just go along with the doctor and rest up,&#8221;
commanded Mrs. Hodder, when the tray appeared. &#8220;He
told me he was going to take you out to dinner&mdash;and I
guess you need it&mdash;living on canned stuff, so. He thinks
I can get down to-morrow, and I certainly do hope so.
You look about beat out&mdash;and no wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this cordial send-off Black ran downstairs like a
boy let out of school, his weariness already lessening under
the stimulus of the coming adventure. Tired? Just
to amuse himself, late last evening, he had made a list of
the things he had done, the people he had seen, the letters
he had written, the telephone calls he had answered&mdash;and
all the rest of it. It had been a formidable list. And
living on tinned beans, and crackers and cheese, had not
been&mdash;&mdash; Oh, well&mdash;what did it matter, so he had got his
work done, slighted nothing and nobody&mdash;though he could
be by no means sure of that! What minister ever could?</p>

<p>He dressed as Red had ordered&mdash;heavy shoes, sweater
under his overcoat, cap instead of hat&mdash;he felt indeed like
a boy off on a lark, only that his busy, self-supporting life
had not furnished him with many comparisons in the way
of larks. As he ran down the manse steps he realized
that it was a perfect winter night. There had been little
snow of late; the air was dry and not too cold; the stars
were out. And he was going camping in the woods with
Red Pepper Burns&mdash;and it was not up to him to do the
cooking!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>The car slid up to the curb, a big basket in the place
where Black was to put his feet; he had to straddle it.
There was not too much time to spare&mdash;only a little over
two hours. The car leaped away down the street, and
in no time was off over the macadamized road on which
speed could be made. And then, a mile away from that
road, with rough going for that mile&mdash;but who cared?&mdash;they
came to a clump of woods lying on a hillside, and the
two were out and scrambling up it in the dark, Red evidently
following a trail with accuracy, for Black found no
difficulty in keeping up with him.</p>

<p>Upon the top of the hill was a bare, stony space, sheltered
from the sides but open to the stars. And here, in
astonishingly little time, were made two leaping fires the
basis for which had been a small basket of materials
brought in the car, upon which hot foundation the gathered
sticks of the wood had no choice but to burn. Rustling
fuel with energy, Black soon found himself ready to discard
his overcoat, and by the time the thick steak Red
was manipulating had reached its rich perfection, as only
that master of camp cookery could make it, Black was
thinking that, big as it was, he could devour the whole of
it himself.</p>

<p>Coffee&mdash;what coffee! Had he ever known the taste
of it before, Black wondered, as he sniffed the delicious
fragrance? Red had worked so swiftly&mdash;in entire silence&mdash;that
the hands of Black&#8217;s watch pointed to a bare seven
o&#8217;clock when he set his teeth into the first hot, juicy morsel
of meat, feeling like a starved hound who has been fed
upon scraps for a month.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, jolly!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;I never tasted anything
so good in my life. Or was so warm on a winter night&mdash;outdoors!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;You bet you never tasted anything so good&mdash;nor were
so warm outdoors. Why, man, you&#8217;ve missed the best
fun in life, if this is your first experience. How does it
happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never done anything but work, and my work
never took me into the woods, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ve looked at
them longingly many a time, but&mdash;there was always
something else to do. What a place this is! Of all places
on earth to come to to-night this seems the best. It&#8217;s
an old favourite camping spot of yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of many. This is nearest&mdash;I can run to it when
I haven&#8217;t time to get farther. Even so&mdash;I don&#8217;t manage
it very often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t!&#8221; Black&#8217;s eyes, in the firelight,
looked across into Red&#8217;s. The moment the cookery was
done Red had replenished both fires, and the two men now
sat on two facing logs between them. &#8220;Your time is
fuller than that of any man I ever knew,&#8221; Black added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of busy men in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. But your hours are fuller than their full
hours because of what you do&mdash;your profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do only what I have to do. But you&mdash;I wonder if
you know it, Black&mdash;you&#8217;re a spendthrift!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; The explosive tone spoke amazement.</p>

<p>Red nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting to tell you for some
time. Do you know you probably weigh about fifteen
pounds less than you did when you came here? Keep
that up, and you&#8217;ll be down to rock bottom.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black laughed. He held up one arm, the hand clenched.
&#8220;Do you remember the challenge I gave you last summer,
Doctor, to a wrestle, any time you might take me up?
If we weren&#8217;t both stuffed, just now, I&#8217;d have it out with
you, here and now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;Very likely you could put it all over me&mdash;though I&#8217;m
not so sure of that.&#8221; Red was eyeing his companion with
the professional eye still. &#8220;But&mdash;go on as you are doing,
and a year from now it&#8217;ll be different. You&#8217;re wasting
nervous energy&mdash;and you can&#8217;t afford to. It&#8217;s as I say&mdash;you&#8217;re
a spendthrift. What&#8217;s the use?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Scotsman&mdash;and that&#8217;s equivalent to saying I
spend only what&#8217;s necessary. It&#8217;s a contradiction in
terms&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not&mdash;excuse me. I&#8217;ve been reading about one
of your Scottish regiments over there&mdash;cut to pieces&mdash;and
they knew they were going to be when they went into
it. Call them thrifty&mdash;of their lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s different. They were glorious. As for
that, Doctor&mdash;to right-about-face with my defense&mdash;why
shouldn&#8217;t one be a spendthrift with his life? You&#8217;re one
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I. I practice my profession, and mine only.
You practice&mdash;about four. Last week I caught you playing
nurse to a family of small children while their mother
went shopping.&#8221; Red held up a silencing hand at Black&#8217;s
laughter. &#8220;Yes, I know she hadn&#8217;t been out for a month.
That same night you made a speech somewhere&mdash;and sat
up the rest of the night with Cary Ray&mdash;&mdash; Oh, yes&mdash;I
know he&#8217;s improved a lot lately, but he got restless that
night and you stuck by. Next day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Burns&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. Next day you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you come to be keeping tab on me?&#8221; Black
stood up, fire in his eye. &#8220;See here! Last week you did
seven operations on patients who couldn&#8217;t afford to pay
you a cent&mdash;and they weren&#8217;t in charity wards, either.
Day before yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>But he had to stop, having but fairly begun. Red&#8217;s
expression said he wouldn&#8217;t stand for it. The two regarded
each other in the light of the fires, and both faces
were glowing ruddily. They suggested two antagonists
about to spring.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m a spendthrift, so are you!&#8221; Black challenged.
&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t we be, at that? Who gets anything out
of life&mdash;not to mention giving anything&mdash;who isn&#8217;t a
spendthrift? &#8216;<i>He who saveth his life shall lose it</i>&#8217;&mdash;and
nobody knows that better than you, Doctor Burns!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you waste yours, you know,&#8221; said Burns, with
emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more than you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do it to save life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do I do it for?&#8221; The question came back
like a shot, with stinging emphasis and challenge.</p>

<p>The two pairs of eyes continued to meet clashingly, and
for a minute neither would give way. Then Red said,
with a rather grudging admission, &#8220;I know you think you
have to do all these extras, and you do them with intent
and purpose, and willingly, at that. But I don&#8217;t back
down on my proposition&mdash;that you&#8217;re working harder at
it than is necessary. I&#8217;ll admit I want you to do what you
can for Cary Ray&mdash;for his sister&#8217;s sake. But when it
comes to the DuBoises, and the Corrigans, and the Andersons&mdash;why
should you spend yourself on them&mdash;ungrateful beggars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only ask you, Doctor, why you spend yourself
on the Wellands and the Kalanskys, and the Kellys?&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Red&#8217;s attitude changed, with one of those
characteristic quick shifts which made him such delightful
company. He looked at his watch and sat down on the
log again. &#8220;Six minutes to stay, and then back to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
blamed committee meeting for yours, and back to my
office for me&mdash;I can see ten people sitting there now, in my
mind&#8217;s eye. Hang it&mdash;why can&#8217;t a fellow stay in the open
when it&#8217;s there he can be at his best, physically and
mentally?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to make you a bit pugilistic!&#8221;</p>

<p>Red looked up, laughing. &#8220;How about you? For a
parson it strikes me you can fight back with both fists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor&mdash;let&#8217;s have that wrestle now! I&#8217;d like it to
remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would, would you? Hold on&mdash;don&#8217;t take off your
coat. I know better than to play tricks with my digestion
like that, if you don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re younger than I&mdash;you
might get away with it. But&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you that tussle
some day you&#8217;re so anxious for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meanwhile&mdash;I wish you&#8217;d give me something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Red was instantly on his guard&mdash;Black
could see that clearly. He had expected it. But
it did not deter him from saying the thing he wanted to
say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake hands with me. Did you know you never
have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the way I want you to. I&#8217;m asking you now to
shake hands with my profession. I&#8217;m tired of having you
against it. I ask you to give it fair play in your mind.
You admit that it&#8217;s worth while for you to spend the last
drop you have for human life. But it&#8217;s wasting good red
blood for a man to spend his for human souls. Do you
mean it? Ah, Doctor Burns, you don&#8217;t. Tell me so&mdash;the
way I want you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suspicion dropped out of Red&#8217;s eyes, but into them
came something else&mdash;the showing of a dogged human will.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
He stood looking into the fire, his hands in his pockets&mdash;where
they had been for some time. He made no motion
to withdraw them. Black&#8217;s hands were clasped behind
him&mdash;he made no motion to extend them. A long silence
succeeded&mdash;or long it seemed to Black, at least. Had
he lost his case? He had never thought to state it thus
to Red&mdash;but when the moment came it had seemed to
him he could do no otherwise.... His heart beat
rather heavily.... How was Red going to take it?</p>

<p>The red-headed surgeon looked up at last. &#8220;Do you
mean you want me to shake hands with your entire profession&mdash;all
the men in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there no charlatans in medicine? But <i>you</i>&mdash;are
the real thing. I wouldn&#8217;t deny you a handshake&mdash;if
you wanted it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly Red drew his right hand out of his pocket.
&#8220;You want this tribute&mdash;to you, as a minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Black&#8217;s eyes flamed. He took a step backward.
&#8220;I want no &#8216;tribute,&#8217; Doctor,&mdash;my heaven!&mdash;you don&#8217;t
think that! All I want is&mdash;to know that&mdash;as a minister
you can shake hands with me and believe&mdash;that I&#8217;m as real
as I know you to be. If you can&#8217;t do that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he turned
aside. &#8220;Oh, never mind! I didn&#8217;t mean to try to force
it from you. Let&#8217;s be off. It must be high time, and
it&#8217;s more than high time if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A hand fell on his shoulder and stayed there. Another
hand found his and gripped it tight. &#8220;Oh, come along.
Bob Black!&#8221; said a gruff voice with yet a ring in it.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the realest chap I know. And I&#8217;ve tried my
darned best not to like you&mdash;and I can&#8217;t get away with
it. <i>Now</i>&mdash;are you satisfied?&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;SIS, I&#8217;ll stump you to go to church with me this
morning!&#8221;</p>

<p>It may have been rather a peculiar form of invitation to
attend upon the service of the sanctuary, but that was not
the reason for the startled expression on Jane Ray&#8217;s face.
She simply couldn&#8217;t believe that it was her brother Cary
who was making the proposal. Church!&mdash;when had Cary
ever gone to any church whatever?&mdash;unless it might have
been for the purpose of gathering material for some brilliant,
ironic article with which to do his share in that old
fight of the world against the forms of religion. As for herself&mdash;it
had long been her custom to employ her Sunday
mornings in making up her business accounts for the week.</p>

<p>Her reply was a parry. &#8220;What church would you
suggest going to?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cary&#8217;s glance at her was both sharp and whimsical. &#8220;Is
there more than one? According to what I hear, the &#8216;Stone
Church,&#8217; as they call it, is the one where the town is flocking
to hear our friend, the fighting parson, say things that
stop the breath. I understand his trustees are mostly
pacifists. It must grind &#8217;em like fun to hear their Scotsman
firing his machine-gun, regardless. I admit I want to
be in on it. I think this country&#8217;s going to get into it before
long, and when it does I expect to see Robert Black
off like a shot for some place where pacifists are unpopular.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;He has never asked us to come to his church,&#8221; Jane
temporized.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That&#8217;s why I want to go. I&#8217;ve been waiting
all this while to have him ask me, so I could turn him down.
But he never has, so, being quite human, I&#8217;m piqued into
going on my own motion. Come along, Sis. I&#8217;ll guarantee
if an old sinner like me can stand the gaff, a young
saint like you will be in her element.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane gave him a sparkling smile. &#8220;Very well, Cary
Ray. It will be your fault if we feel like fish very much
out of water and don&#8217;t know how to act. I haven&#8217;t been
in a church in at least three years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The more shame to you. Most of them are mighty
comfortable places in which to sit and pursue your own
train of thought, and on that ground alone you should be
a constant attendant. Though I doubt very much if
we are able to pursue any train of thought, within hearing
of R. Black, except the one he chooses to put up to us.
The more I&#8217;ve seen of him the more I&#8217;ve discovered of his
little tendency to keep one occupied with him exclusively.
Well, if you&#8217;ll go I&#8217;ll have a clean shave and look up my
best gloves. We&#8217;ll give him a bit of a surprise. To tell the
truth, I&#8217;m beginning to think we owe it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be small doubt of this. In the three
months which had intervened between Cary Ray&#8217;s arrival&mdash;for
all hope there seemed of him, both physically and morally
down and out&mdash;Robert Black had stood steadily by
him. His comradeship had been a direct challenge to
Cary&#8217;s better self, and all that was good in the young man&mdash;and
there was undoubtedly very much&mdash;had rallied
to meet the sturdy beckoning of this new friend. At an
early date the two had discovered that, different as they
were in character, they had one thing mightily in common&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
delights and tortures of the creative brain. Jane
had called Cary a genius, and so he was&mdash;perhaps in the
lesser and more commonly used meaning of the too much
used word. His articles on any theme were always welcomed
in certain of the best newspaper and magazine
offices, and only his lack of dependability and his erratic
ways of working had kept him from rapid advancement
in his world.</p>

<p>Black, discovering almost at once that he had to deal
with a brain which, if it could be freed from the handicap
of dissipation, would be capable of production worth any
effort to salvage from the threatened wreck, had thrown
himself, heart and soul, into winning Cary&#8217;s friendship on
the ground of their common interest and understanding.
To do this he had used every particle of skill he possessed,
and his reward had been the knowledge of the steadily
lengthening periods of Cary&#8217;s reasonableness and his response
to the stimulus which will always be greater than
almost any other&mdash;the demand of a friend who cares that
we live up to his belief in us. Cary had come to think
of Robert Black as the best friend he had in the world,
after his sister, and to look forward to the hours the two
spent together as the brightest spots in a life which had
become dimmed at an age when it should have known its
fullest zest.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Robert Black, entering his
pulpit that Sunday morning, and presently taking estimate
of his congregation, as a preacher must do if he is to know
how to aim accurately and fire straight, caught sight of
two people whose presence before him gave him a distinct
shock of surprise. He had been sure he would some time
get that shock, but it had been long delayed, and he had
rather doggedly persisted in withholding the direct invitation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
reasoning with himself that he would rather have
Jane and Cary come for any other reason than the paying
of the debt he knew they must feel they owed him.</p>

<p>And now they were there before him&mdash;rather near him,
too. Young Perkins, one of the ushers for the middle
aisle, had pounced on them as a pair who would do credit
to his natural desire to have all the best dressed and most
distinguished looking strangers placed where they would
do the most good to the personnel of the congregation.
He knew Jane for what he called &#8220;a stunner,&#8221; thereby
paying youthful tribute to her looks and quiet perfection
of dress. As for Cary, one glance of appraisal had placed
him, for Perkins, in the class of the &#8220;classy,&#8221; than which
there is no greater compliment in the vocabulary of the
Perkinses. Therefore it was that Perkins, leading Jane
and Cary down the middle aisle, had complacently slipped
them into the pew of one of the leading members&mdash;to-day
out of town, as he knew&mdash;and thus had left them within
exceedingly close range of whatever gunfire might be at
the command of the pulpit. Perkins, having hurriedly
scanned the headlines of the morning papers, had a hunch
that it was going to be one of those mornings when the
congregation would be likely to leave the church with
its hair a trifle rampant on its brow from excited thrustings&mdash;or
with its hats a little askew from agitated noddings
or shakings. He had come to look forward to such Sundays
with increasing zest. There was something else to
stake quarters on with the other ushers, these days, than
on how late Doctor Burns was going to be at church, or
how short a time he would be permitted to remain there.
Perkins was beginning to wonder how he had ever endured
the dull times of Black&#8217;s immediate predecessor; certainly
he was rejoicing that they were over.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Frances Fitch, in the Lockhart pew, just across the
aisle and two rows behind Jane and Cary, found the pair
a particularly interesting study. Through Tom she had
heard much of Cary; she had caught only unsatisfying
glimpses before. As he sat at the end of the pew nearest
the aisle she had a full view of that profile which had first
assured Black that Cary was indeed Jane&#8217;s brother, and
it now struck Miss Fitch as one of the most attractive
masculine outlines she had ever seen. Cary was still
distinctly pale, but his pallor was becoming more healthy
with each succeeding day of Jane&#8217;s skillful feeding, and his
manner had lost its excessive nervousness. To the eye,
by now, he merely looked the interesting convalescent
from a possibly severe illness, with every probability of a
complete return to full fitness of body. As to his mind&mdash;one
glance at him could hardly help suggesting to the intelligent
observer that here was a young man who possessed
brains trained to the point of acuteness and efficiency in
whatever lines they might be employed.</p>

<p>To look at either Cary or Jane, moreover, one would
hardly have said that church was to them so unaccustomed
a place. Jane, sitting or rising with the rest, sharing
hymn-book or printed leaf of the responsive service with
her brother, appeared the most decorous of regular communicants.
For herself, however, she was experiencing
many curious reactions, the most distinct of which,
throughout the preliminary service, was caused by the
sight of Robert McPherson Black, in his gown, and with
the high gravity upon him which she had never before
seen in precisely its present quality. Could this be the
spirited young man who came so often to spend an hour
with Cary, his face and manner full of a winning gayety
or of an equally winning vigour of speech and action?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
This was another being indeed who confronted her, a
being removed from her as by a great gulf fixed, his fine
eyes by no chance meeting hers, his voice by no means
addressed to her, but to the remotest person in his audience,
far back under the gallery. For the first time Jane
Ray was realizing that well as it had seemed to her that
she had come to know the man Black, she actually knew
him hardly at all, for here, in this place to her so unfamiliar,
was his real home!</p>

<p>And then, very soon came an equally strong reaction
from this first impression of remoteness. For, the moment
the anthems and the responses and the rest of the
preliminary service was over, and Black had been for
three minutes upon his feet in his office of preacher, the
whole situation was reversed. No longer did he seem to
be sending that trained and reverent voice of his to every
quarter of the large, hushed audience room; but in a new
and arresting way he was addressing Jane Ray very directly,
he was speaking straight to her, and she had quite
forgotten that there was any one else there to hear. If
this impression of hers was precisely like that which
reached each person within sound of his voice who possessed
the intelligence to listen, that was nothing to her&mdash;nor
to them. The simple fact was that when Robert
Black spoke to an audience as from his very first word
he was speaking now, that audience had no choice but
to listen, and it listened as individuals, with each of whom
he was intimately concerned.</p>

<p>As for Cary Ray&mdash;perhaps there was nobody in that
whole audience so well qualified to measure the speaker&#8217;s
ability and power as he. He had spent no small portion
of his early after-college days in reporting for a great city
daily, and his assignment very often had been the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
up of one noted speaker after another. He had listened
to eloquence of all sorts, spurious and real; had come to
be a judge of quality in human speech in all its ramifications;
was by now himself a literary critic of no inferior
sort. His mind, at its best&mdash;and it was not far short of
its best on this Sunday morning&mdash;was keen and clear. As
he gave himself up to Black as one gives himself up to a
friend who is setting before him a matter of import, he was
a hearer of the sort whom speakers would go far to find.</p>

<p>Did Black know this? Unquestionably he did. He
knew also that Red was in his audience this morning, and
Jane Ray, and Nan Lockhart, and Fanny Fitch, and
many another, and that every last one of them was listening
as almost never before. How could they help but
hear, when he was saying to them that which challenged
their attention as he was challenging it now?</p>

<p>This was in February, nineteen seventeen. Diplomatic
relations with Germany had been severed; America was
on the brink of war. One tremendous question was engaging
the whole country: was it America&#8217;s duty to go
into war? Was it her necessity? Was it&mdash;and here a few
voices were rising loud and clear&mdash;was it not only her
necessity and her duty&mdash;was it her privilege?</p>

<p>No doubt where Robert Black stood. It was America&#8217;s
privilege, the acceptance of which had been already too
long postponed. In no uncertain terms he made his conviction
clear. The blood baptism which was purifying
the souls of other countries must be ours as well, or never
again could we be clean. To save our souls&mdash;to save our
souls&mdash;that was his plea!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wish,&#8221; he cried out suddenly toward the end,
&#8220;I wish I had the dramatic power to set the thing before
you so that you might see it as you see a convincing play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
upon a stage. Never a human drama like this one&mdash;and
we&mdash;are sitting in the boxes! Bathed and clean clothed
and gloved&mdash;gloved&mdash;we are sitting in the boxes and looking
on&mdash;and applauding now and then&mdash;as loudly as we
may, wearing gloves! And over there&mdash;their hands are
torn and bleeding with wounds&mdash;while we delay&mdash;and
delay&mdash;and delay!&#8221;</p>

<p>Down in the pew before him Cary Ray suddenly
clenched his fists. His arms had been folded&mdash;<i>his</i> hands
were gloved. Gloved hands could clench then! Into
his brain&mdash;now afire with Black&#8217;s own fire, as it had been
more than once before now as the two talked war together&mdash;but
never as now&mdash;never as now&mdash;there sprang
an idea, glowing with life. His writer&#8217;s instinct leaped
at it, turned it inside out and back again, saw it through
to its ultimate effort&mdash;and never once lost track of Black&#8217;s
closing words, or missed a phrase of the brief prayer that
followed, a prayer that seemed to rise visibly from the
altar, so burning were the words of it. Cary rose from his
seat, a man illumined with a purpose.</p>

<p>Up the aisle he felt Red&#8217;s hand upon his arm. Those
orders to the usher not to call the red-headed doctor out
for anything but an emergency had been regularly in
force of late. Astonishingly often was the once absentee
now able to make connections with his pew, at least in
time for the sermon. To his friend Macauley, who now
and then let loose jeering comments upon the subject of
his change of ways, he was frank to admit that it did make
a difference in the drawing power of the church whether
the man in the pulpit could aim only soft and futile blows,
or whether he could hit straight and fast and hard. &#8220;And
whether,&#8221; Red added once, bluntly, &#8220;you happen to
know that he practises precisely what he preaches.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>In Cary&#8217;s ear Red now said incisively: &#8220;What are you
betting that sermon will cost him half his congregation?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cary turned, his dark eyes afire. &#8220;If it does, we&#8217;ll fill
it up with vagrants like me. My lord, that was hot stuff!
And this is the first time I&#8217;ve heard him&mdash;more fool I.
Why didn&#8217;t you let a fellow know?&#8221;</p>

<p>Red laughed rather ruefully. &#8220;Cary,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s
astonishing how we do go on entertaining angels unawares.
But when we get one with a flaming sword, like this one,
we&#8217;re just as liable to cut and run as to stay by and get
our own hands on a hilt somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got mine on one, I promise you,&#8221; murmured Cary.
His one idea now was to reach home and lay his hand
upon it. If, to him, his fountain pen was the trustiest
sword in his arsenal, let none disparage that mighty
weapon. In his hands, if those hands remained steady,
it might in time do some slashing through obstacles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was just three days later that Jane Ray, coming in
from the shop, saw Cary sling that pen&mdash;hurriedly capped
for the purpose&mdash;clear across the table, at which for those
three days he had been writing almost steadily. He threw
up his arms in a gesture of mingled fatigue and triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Janey,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want you to send for Robert Black,
and Doctor and Mrs. Burns, and your friend Miss Lockhart&mdash;you
told me she wrote plays at college, didn&#8217;t you?&mdash;and
her friend, Miss Fitch, the raving beauty who acts&mdash;probably
acts all the time, but none the worse for that,
for my purpose. Also, Tommy Lockhart. I want &#8217;em
all, and I want &#8217;em quick. I can&#8217;t sleep till I&#8217;ve had &#8217;em
here to listen to what I&#8217;ve done. And now&mdash;if I weren&#8217;t
under your roof, and if I didn&#8217;t care such a blamed lot
about not letting Black down&mdash;I&#8217;d go out and take a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
drink. Oh, don&#8217;t worry&mdash;I won&#8217;t&mdash;not just yet, anyhow.
I&#8217;ll go out and take a walk instead. My head&#8217;s on
fire and my feet are two chunks from the North Pole.&#8221;</p>

<p>Happier than she had been for a long time, her hopes
for her brother rising higher than they had yet dared to
rise, in spite of all the encouragement his improvement
had given her, Jane made haste to summon these people
whose presence he had demanded. They came on short
notice; even Red, who said at first that he couldn&#8217;t make
it by any possible chance, electrified them all and made
Cary&#8217;s pale cheek glow with satisfaction when at the last
minute he appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you, who are you to interfere with my
schedule?&#8221; Red growled, as he shook hands. &#8220;I was due
at a Medical Society Meeting, where I was booked as
leader of a discussion. They&#8217;ll discuss the thing to tatters
without me, while I could have rounded &#8217;em up and
driven &#8217;em into the corral with one big discovery that
they&#8217;re not onto yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mighty sorry, Doctor. But, you see, I had to have
you.&#8221; Cary grinned at him impudently. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
raving crazy for three days and nights, and if I can&#8217;t call
in medical aid on the strength of that&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I know
I&#8217;m mighty presumptuous, but&mdash;well&mdash;listen, and I&#8217;ll try
to justify myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>They listened for an hour. They could hardly help
it. As a down-and-outer Cary Ray had been an object of
solicitude and sympathy; as a clever, forceful, intensely
yet restrainedly dramatic playwright, he was a person to
astonish and take his new acquaintances off their feet.
Stirred as he had been, gripped by the big idea Black had
unknowingly put into his head, he had gone at this task
as he had time and again gone at a difficult piece of newspaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
work. With every faculty alert, every sense of the
dramatic possibilities of the conception stringing him to
a tension, his thoughts thronging, his language fluid, his
whole being had been sharpened into an instrument which
his brain, the master, might command to powerful purpose.
Thus had he written the one-act war play which was to
fire the imagination, enlist the sympathies, capture the
hearts of thousands of those who later saw it put upon
the vaudeville circuit, where its influence, cumulative as
the fame of it spread and the press comments grew in
wonder and praise, was accountable for many a patriotic
word and act which otherwise never had been born.</p>

<p>But now&mdash;he was reading it for the first time to this
little audience of chosen people, &#8220;trying it out on them,&#8221;
as the phrase ran in his own mind. He had no possible
doubt of its reception. His own judgment, trained to
pass upon his own performance with as critical a sureness
as upon that of any other man, told him that he had done a
remarkable piece of work. To him it was ancient history
that when he could write as he had written now, with
neither let nor hindrance to the full use of his powers, it
followed as the night the day that his editors would put
down the sheets with that grim smile with which they
were wont to accept the best a man could do, nod at him,
possibly say: &#8220;Great stuff, Ray,&#8221;&mdash;and brag about it
afterward where he could not hear.</p>

<p>To-night, when he laid down the last sheet and got up
to stroll over to a shadowy corner and get rid of his own
overwrought emotion as best he might, he understood
that the silence which succeeded the reading was his
listeners&#8217; first and deepest tribute to his art. His climax
had been tremendous, led up to by every least word and
indicated action that had gone before, the finished product<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
of a nearly perfect craftsmanship. Small wonder that
for a long minute nobody found voice to express the
moved and shaken condition in which each found himself.</p>

<p>But when it did come, there was nothing wanting. If
they were glad beyond measure, these people, that they
could honestly approve the work of this brother of Jane&#8217;s,
this was but a small part of the feeling which now had its
strong hold upon them. Wonder, delight, eagerness to
see the little drama glow like a jewel upon the stage&mdash;these
were what brought words to the tongue at length.
And then&mdash;plans!</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t get it on too quick,&#8221; was Red&#8217;s instant decision.
&#8220;It must be done here first, and then turned loose
on the circuit. We can handle it. Nan Lockhart can
help you get it up, Cary&mdash;and take the part of the Englishwoman,
too. Of course Miss Fitch must do the French
actress&mdash;she&#8217;s cut out for that. I&#8217;m inclined to think
my wife would make the best Belgian mother. Tom can
be the wounded young poilu, and you, Ray&mdash;will be the
French officer to the life. As for the rest&mdash;we have plenty
of decidedly clever young actors who will be equal to the
minor parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a general laugh. &#8220;I seem to see the footlights
turned on already,&#8221; Cary declared. &#8220;But that&#8217;s
not a bad assignment. Would you&mdash;&#8221; he turned to
Black&mdash;&#8220;I wonder if you would take the part of the
American surgeon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now this was a great part, if a small one as to actual
lines. Every eye turned to the minister. Fit the part&mdash;with
that fine, candid face, those intent eyes? No doubt
that he did. But he shook his head with decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do much for you, Ray,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but not that.
It&#8217;s not possible for me to take a part. I&#8217;ve a real reason,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
as Cary&#8217;s lips opened, &#8220;so don&#8217;t try to persuade
me. But I&#8217;ll help in every way I can. And as for the
surgeon&mdash;why not take the one at hand?&#8221; And he indicated
Burns himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll <i>do</i> it!&#8221; announced Red, most unexpectedly.</p>

<p>They spent a fascinated hour discussing the characters
and who could do them full justice. There was nobody
to see, but if there had been a disinterested onlooker, he
might have said to himself that here was a group of people
who of themselves were playing out a little drama of their
own, each quite unconsciously taking a significant part.
There was R. P. Burns, M.D.&mdash;his red head and vigorous
personality more or less dominating the scene. There was
Ellen Burns, his wife&mdash;dark-eyed, serene, highly intelligent
in the occasional suggestions she made, but mostly allowing
others to talk while she listened with that effect of
deep interest which made her so charming to everyone.
There was Nan Lockhart, quick of wit and eager to bring
all her past training to bear on the situation, her bright
smile or her quizzical frown registering approval or criticism.
There was Fanny Fitch, radiant with delight in the
prospects opening before her, her eyes starry, her face
repeating the rose-leaf hues of the scarf she wore within
her sumptuous dark cape of fur&mdash;somehow Miss Fitch&#8217;s
skillful dressing always gave a point of light and colour
for the eye to rest gratifiedly upon. Then there was
Robert Black, rather quiet to-night, but none the less
a person to be decidedly taken into account, as was
quite unconsciously proved by the eyes which turned his
way whenever he broke his silence with question or suggestion.
There was Tom Lockhart, somehow reminding
one of a well-trained puppy endeavouring to maintain his
dignity while bursting to make mischief; his impish glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
resting on one face after another, his gay young speech
occasionally causing everybody&#8217;s gravity to break down&mdash;as
when he solemnly declared that unless he himself were
allowed to play some austerely exalted part yet to be
written into the play he would go home and never come
back. There was Jane Ray, who sat next Tom, and who
somehow looked to-night as young as he&mdash;younger, even,
than Miss Fitch, whose elegance of attire contrasted curiously
with Jane&#8217;s plain little dark-blue frock. Jane&#8217;s brunette
beauty was deeply enhanced to-night by her warm
colour and her brilliant smile; her sparkling eyes as she
watched her brother gave everybody the impression that
she was gloriously happy&mdash;as indeed she was. For was
not Cary&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Cary himself was probably the figure in the room which,
if this little scene had been actually part of a drama, would
have become the focus of the audience&#8217;s absorption. Interesting
as they were, the other actors only contributed
to his success&mdash;he was the centre of the stage. Dark,
lithe, his excitement showing only in his flashing eyes,
his manner cool, controlled&mdash;he was the picture of an actor
himself. He was keenly aware that the tables had suddenly
been turned, and that from being a mysterious sort
of invalid, Jane&#8217;s ne&#8217;er-do-well brother, he had emerged
in an hour. He had gathered a wreath of laurels and set
it upon his own brow, and was now challenging them all
to say if he had not a place in the world after all, could
not claim it by right of his amazing ability, could not ask
to be forgiven all his sins in view of his dazzling exhibition
of an art nobody had realized he possessed. Undeniably
this was Cary&#8217;s hour, and Jane, being only human,
and loving him very much, was daring to believe once
again that her brother was redeemed to her. It may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
not be wondered at that now and again her eyes rested
gratefully upon the two men who had done this thing for
Cary&mdash;and for her. She knew that they must be rejoicing,
too.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, something of a shock to her when
from Robert Black, before they left, she had a low-toned
warning. &#8220;Miss Ray&mdash;&#8221; Black had chosen his opportunity
carefully; for the moment the two were well apart
from the rest&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare not tell you to look out
for him to-night. After we are gone, and he is alone,
there will come an hour of&mdash;well&mdash;he will be more vulnerable
than he has been for a month. Don&#8217;t let him slip
away&mdash;see him safely relaxed and asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s expression was incredulous. &#8220;Oh, not to-night,
when he is so proud and happy&mdash;so glad to have you all
his friends, and to show you at last that he is your equal in&mdash;so
many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded gravely: &#8220;Believe me, I know what I&#8217;m
saying. It&#8217;s a bit of an intoxication in itself, this reaction
from his long languor of mind. He&#8217;s done a magnificent
thing, and he&#8217;s now in very great danger. Don&#8217;t allow
yourself to minimize it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re very good!&#8221; Jane&#8217;s tone was a little impatient,
in spite of herself. &#8220;But you do misjudge him&mdash;to-night.
Why, he&#8217;s just his old self&mdash;as you&#8217;ve never
known him. Of course, I&#8217;ll stay by him&mdash;and I understand.
But&mdash;his temptation has always been when he
was blue and unhappy, not when he was on the top wave
of joy, as he is to-night&mdash;as he deserves to be&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her
voice broke a little, she turned away. She herself was
keyed higher than she knew; she simply couldn&#8217;t bear to
have Robert Black, or anybody else, distrust Cary to-night&mdash;dear,
wonderful Cary, with his shining eyes and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
adorable smile, her beloved brother and his genius both
restored to her.</p>

<p>Black&#8217;s low voice came after her: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;I didn&#8217;t
mean to hurt your happiness to-night, of all nights. I
only&mdash;want you to take care of him as&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was off, back to her guests, cutting him short,
with only a nod and half smile back at him, which showed
him that she thought him wrong&mdash;and a little cruel, too.</p>

<p>She was surer than ever that he had been mistaken when
they were all gone, their congratulations on Cary&#8217;s work
still ringing in her ears. He threw himself upon the couch
with a long laughing breath and a prolonged stretch of the
arms. &#8220;Smoke and ashes, but I&#8217;m tired!&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stop and chin with you about ten minutes, and then
it&#8217;s me for bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed hardly to listen while she told him how she
felt about his work and the evening, how she knew they
all felt. She could see that he was all at once very sleepy
and exhausted, and when, before the ten minutes were
barely up, he rose and stumbled across the room, declaring
that he couldn&#8217;t hold out another second, she smiled to
herself as she put her arm on his shoulder and insisted on
his good-night kiss. He had to cut a yawn in two to give
it to her. This tired boy in any danger? Hardly! If
he had still been excited and overstrung she might have
had fears for him, but now&mdash;why, he would be asleep before
he could get his clothes off&mdash;that was what was most
likely to happen, after these three days and nights of consuming
labour. She would look in, by and by, and make
sure that, as in his boyish days, he had not thrown himself
across the bed without undressing at all, and gone off into
a deep slumber from which her sisterly ministrations would
not wake him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>She never knew what actually happened that night.
She was a long time herself in making ready for bed, and
so busy were her thoughts that for an hour she quite forgot
her resolve to make sure of Cary&#8217;s safety. Then, just to
prove that Black was unreasonable in his fears, she went
to Cary&#8217;s door, opened it very gently, and saw in the bed
his motionless figure, evidently in as deep a sleep as any
one could wish. She went back to her own room with
a curious sense of injury upon her. Why had the minister
tried to alarm her when there was so little need? Hadn&#8217;t
she had anxious hours enough?</p>

<p>Within a quarter of an hour the door of the shop very
softly opened, and Cary Ray let himself out into the silent
little street. His coat-collar was up, his hat pulled over
his eyes; he stole away on noiseless feet. If Jane could
have seen then the eyes beneath that sheltering hat-brim
she would have understood. Sleep? They had never
been farther from it, so glitteringly sleepless were they.</p>

<p>But Robert Black saw those eyes&mdash;and he had already
understood. As Cary slipped round the corner he ran
straight into a tall figure coming his way. With a low
exclamation of dismay he would have rushed by and away,
but Black wheeled and was at his side, walking with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out for a walk, Ray?&#8221; said the low, friendly voice he
had come to know so well. &#8220;I know how that is&mdash;I&#8217;ve
often done it myself. Nothing like the crisp night air for
taking that boiling blood out of a fellow&#8217;s brain and sending
it over his body, where it belongs. May I walk with
you? I&#8217;m still abnormally keyed-up myself over that
play of yours. No wonder you can&#8217;t settle to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, Cary couldn&#8217;t get away, and he knew he couldn&#8217;t.
As well try to escape an officer&#8217;s handcuff if he had been
caught stealing as that kind, inexorable offer of comradeship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
through his temptation. He knew Black well enough
by now to know that his standing by meant that he simply
wouldn&#8217;t let Cary&#8217;s temptation have a chance&mdash;it might
as well slink away and leave him, for it couldn&#8217;t get to
him past Robert Black&#8217;s defense.</p>

<p>Quite possibly neither of these two ever could have told
how many miles they walked that icy winter&#8217;s night, but
walk they did till every drop of Cary&#8217;s hot blood was
rushing healthily through his weary body, and the fires
in his brain had died the death they must inevitably die
under such treatment. They walked in silence for the
most part. Cary wasn&#8217;t angry, even at the first&mdash;he was
ashamed, disappointed&mdash;but not angry. How could he
be really angry with a man who loved him enough for this?
And, deep down in his heart, presently he was glad&mdash;glad
to be saved from himself. Was it for the man who
had written that splendid play to take it out in the old
degradation; was it for him who had made Truth shine in
an embodiment of loveliness to drag its creator in the
mire on this same night that his friends had looked upon
his work and declared that it was good? When at last he
stumbled wearily along the little street again, with a stumbling
that was no feigning this time but the genuine sign
of a fatigue so overpowering that sleep was almost on
its heels, he was thankful to this strange and comprehending
friend as he had never been thankful to him before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Ray,&#8221; said Robert Black, at the shop
door, and under the street-light Cary saw the smile that
had come to mean more to him to-night than it ever had
before&mdash;and it had meant much already.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you trust me now?&#8221; Cary met the dark eyes
straightforwardly at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. I trusted <i>you</i> before. It was the over-strained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
nerves and brain I was anxious for, because I&#8217;ve
had them many a time myself. They&#8217;re hard to manage.
Taking them to walk is just good medicine, that&#8217;s all.
You&#8217;ll sleep like a top, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re sure I won&#8217;t slide out, when you&#8217;re gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black&#8217;s hand gripped Cary&#8217;s. &#8220;I&#8217;d stake my life on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cary choked a little as he returned the grip. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t need to. I&#8217;d prefer to stake mine.&#8221; Then he bolted,
and the shop door closed behind him.</p>

<p>Black looked up at the wide-open window over the shop
he knew was Jane&#8217;s. &#8220;Sleep well, my friend,&#8221; he was
thinking. &#8220;I told you I&#8217;d stand by you&mdash;to the limit.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>A SHIFTING OF HONOURS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TOM LOCKHART emerged from the stage dressing-room
in the uniform of a French soldier, his face made
up with paint and powder and crayon to indicate that he
was in the final stages of suffering from gunshot wounds.
His head was bandaged, his clothes were torn, but he gave
the lie to these signs of disaster by dashing up the stairs
and into the wings of the stage with the lusty action of
perfect health and a great zest for his part.</p>

<p>Behind the big curtain he found all the actors in Cary&#8217;s
play assembled&mdash;except one. The star&mdash;everybody had
taken to calling Fanny Fitch the star throughout the rehearsals&mdash;was
still missing, quite after the manner of stars.
It was yet early, and the audience in front was but half
assembled, but Cary had laid great stress upon everybody&#8217;s
being ready and in the wings before the curtain
should rise. He had small faith in amateur call boys and
prompters, and the action of the play was to take place
so rapidly that nobody could be permitted to linger in a
dressing-room once the piece was on.</p>

<p>Cary greeted Tom as a laggard. Cary himself was a
French officer&mdash;and looked the part to the life; but he was
also a stage manager of martinet qualities.</p>

<p>&#8220;About time, you boy! Where&#8217;s Miss Fitch? Go
back and get her. Hustle!&#8221; The whisper hissed above
the tuning of the orchestra.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Tom sped back downstairs. Red Pepper Burns, in the
dress of an operating surgeon soiled and gory, his face made
up to show lines of fatigue, commented in Nan Lockhart&#8217;s
ear: &#8220;Trust Fanny to play the part off stage as well as
on. Presume she&#8217;s reckoning on holding everything up
till she gets here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan frowned. &#8220;You never do her justice, Doctor
Burns. Fanny&#8217;s a born actress, why shouldn&#8217;t she have
the little sins of one? But she&#8217;s going to surprise you to-night.
She really can act, you know. She&#8217;s been only
walking through rehearsals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;but she&#8217;ll have to get a lot more punch into
her work than I can believe her capable of. Speaking
of punch&mdash;I haven&#8217;t much left myself to-night,&#8221; growled
Red. The fatigue suggested by the lines upon his face
had been easy to lay on, by the make-up man downstairs,
who had had only to intensify those already there. As
might easily have been prophesied by those who knew his
life intimately, Red had just had a week of infernally hard
work in the operating room, and was much fitter for a good
night&#8217;s sleep than for playing the part of a first line
surgeon on the French front.</p>

<p>Robert Black, in the wings, was keeping in order a little
group of children who were representing Belgian orphans&mdash;prot&eacute;g&eacute;s
of an Englishwoman who had come to France
to help look after the refugees. Nan Lockhart had this
part; it fitted her beautifully. Jane Ray was the Red
Cross nurse in charge at the clearing station; her white
uniform and glowing red veil brought out her dusky beauty
of colouring strikingly. Three young American ambulance
drivers&mdash;of whom Harry Perkins, the young usher at
the Stone Church, was one&mdash;stood together in the wings,
commenting favourably upon Miss Ray. Altogether, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
body was really doing anything but waiting when Tom
Lockhart, grinning joyously through his queerly contrasting
pallid make-up, at last followed Fanny Fitch upon
the stage.</p>

<p>She had refused to dress for the dress rehearsal of the
preceding evening, explaining that her costume was as yet
in the making. She had, quite as Nan had said, &#8220;walked
through&#8221; her part and rather languidly, at that, in the
street attire in which she had come to the little theatre
which was the suburban town&#8217;s pride. So now, quite
suddenly and startlingly, appeared to the view of her
fellow actors the French actress of music-hall fame whom
Fanny was to represent in the part which Cary, the moment
he had set eyes upon her&mdash;and, he might have added,
found her eyes upon him&mdash;had declared would fit her like
a glove. As Red and Ellen and Cary Ray and Robert
Black now beheld the dazzling figure before them, there
could be no question in their minds that if Miss Fitch
could act the part as she now looked it, there would be
nothing left to be desired. As for young Tommy Lockhart,
he was clearly quite out of his head with a crazy
admiration which he did not even attempt to disguise.
What was the use? And must not all men be one with
him in adoring this radiant creature?</p>

<p>Fanny was a vision&mdash;there&#8217;s no use denying it. All
that fairness of feature and provocation of eye enhanced
by the cleverest art of the make-up box, and set off by
daring line and colour of gown, could do to make her wondrous
to look upon, had been achieved. All that a deep
excitement, a complete confidence in what her mirror had
told her, a surety of at least a measure of real histrionic
power, could give in aid of the finished effect, was there.
But as she came very quietly upon the stage there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
nothing at all in her bearing to indicate that she thought
herself a form of delight, rather did she suggest that she
was dreading her difficult r&ocirc;le, and not at all confident
that she could hope even to please the eye. Tom, indeed,
could have sworn that this was so. Had he not held a
brief but satisfying dialogue with her on the way upstairs?</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tom!&#8221; she had called, &#8220;is it really time to go on?
I&#8217;m so frightened! Do you suppose I can ever do it as
Mr. Ray wants it done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom, gazing his eyes out at her lovely shoulders, as she
preceded him along the narrow corridor to the stairs,
keeping her scarlet silken skirts well away from the walls&mdash;he
helped her solicitously in that&mdash;answered in eager assurance:
&#8220;Why, of course you can! And&mdash;my word!&mdash;looking
at you would be enough, if you couldn&#8217;t act at all.
My word! I never <i>saw</i> you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but Tom, <i>looking</i> a part is nothing&mdash;and I&#8217;m not
even sure I can do that. But <i>acting</i> it! That&#8217;s another
story. And you&#8217;re so wonderful in yours&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? Why, I just have to die! That&#8217;s easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you do it so realistically&mdash;you&#8217;re absolutely true
to life. When I bend over you&mdash;yes, I do feel that you&#8217;re
actually my brother, and my heart&mdash;&mdash; Well, if that can
help, you do help me. And I&#8217;ll do my best. But&mdash;I&#8217;m
simply scared to pieces. Feel my hand, it&#8217;s freezing!&#8221;
She stretched back one bare arm, and Tom willingly caught
her hand in his. His own was so cold it is doubtful if he
could have detected chill in hers, but he held it fast, chafing
it in both his own, and murmuring tenderly: &#8220;You&#8217;ll
be all right, I know you will. Why, you&#8217;ll have the audience
from the minute you go on&mdash;they can&#8217;t get away
from you&mdash;any more than I can!&#8221; The last was a whisper.</p>

<p>Fanny turned. They were at the top of the stairway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
now, with the wings close at hand. &#8220;Tom, tell me! Do
you really think I can do it? Will you just keep thinking
about me every minute while you&#8217;re lying there?&#8221; She
pressed one hand over her heart with a little gesture of fear
which simply finished Tom. &#8220;Oh, if it <i>would</i> stop beating
so fast&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom slipped his arm about her shoulders. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be afraid, dear,&#8221; was what he began to say. But she
was away from him in an instant, and he could only recall
with tingling pulses that instant&#8217;s touch in which at least
two of his fingers had come into fleeting contact with the
satiny bare arm. The next minute he had rallied and
rushed after her upon the stage, to watch with a jealous
pleasure the looks which fell upon her from all sides.</p>

<p>At sight of the &#8220;star&#8221; Cary Ray came forward. All he
said was, &#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad you&#8217;re here, Miss Fitch.
Real actresses never can be depended upon, you know&mdash;and
you certainly look temperamental enough to give
your stage manager some trouble!&#8221; But his eyes and his
smile said that he was well satisfied with her as a member
of his caste, and that as a girl of his acquaintance he was
immensely glad he knew her. There was promise in
Cary&#8217;s look as well. All Fanny had to do now was to play
that part as she knew she could play it, and Cary Ray
would fall before her. Going out to take a drink, after
the play should be over&mdash;the thing he would naturally
want most to do&mdash;would pale into insignificance before
the stimulus she could offer him, if she but let him take
her home and come in for an hour&#8217;s talk and coffee by the
fire.</p>

<p>But Tom Lockhart and Cary Ray were not the stakes
for which Fanny Fitch meant to play that night. There
was a tall figure in the wings of which she was well aware,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
and though she did not look toward it she was very sure
that Robert Black was watching her. How, indeed, could
he do anything else? Belgian orphans, ambulance drivers,
French officers, Englishwomen, Red Cross nurses&mdash;how
could they all be anything but a background for the lovely
&#8220;star?&#8221; Does not the eye watch the point of high light
in any scene?</p>

<p>And then they were all in their places. Cary rushed about
giving last warnings, the orchestra music dropped to a low
murmur of mystery, and the curtain rose. Black, with
a last word to the waiting children, slipped out of the wings,
down the stairs, up through the orchestra door, and into
a seat held for him by a group of young men who were
now his special friends. It was Cary&#8217;s expressed wish that
he should see the play from the front, and then come back,
with the falling of the curtain, to tell the amateur actor-manager
how it had gone.</p>

<p>No need to relate the whole story of the play. It is
not with the stage performance that we are most concerned,
but with that other play, quite out of sight of the
audience in the little theatre that night, which is to us
more interesting than the scenes they acted behind the
footlights. The stage play dealt with one of those thrilling
situations with which we have all since then, through
printed page and photograph and drama, become familiar.
We know now how those who went across to help, months&mdash;a
year&mdash;two years&mdash;before America came into the
war, felt about us who lagged behind. The young American
ambulance drivers who left their colleges and rushed
over because they couldn&#8217;t stand it that we weren&#8217;t remembering
our debt to France, and who threw themselves
and all they had to give into the breach, angry and proud
and absolutely forgetful of self, just to do their little part&mdash;these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
had Cary pictured in his play, chafing with impatience
because they couldn&#8217;t make all America understand
and care. The American girl whose schooldays had been
spent in Paris, who had many friends there, and who
wanted to put aside everything promised her at home and
go back to the country she had learned to love, to nurse
the Frenchmen who since the war began had taught her
what true gallantry might be&mdash;Cary had sketched her in
his rarest colours, a thing of beauty and of love, her heart
as tender as her spirit was dauntless.</p>

<p>There was the American surgeon, come over at first
because he wanted to study the methods of the French
and English surgeons, but staying out of sheer pity, and
grimly working now to the last limit of his endurance,
unwilling to desert while the need was so great, calling
with every eloquent word he could find time to write back
to his brothers in the profession to come and help him stay
the flood of suffering. Drivers and nurses and doctors&mdash;these
were the characters whom Cary had chosen with
which to make his appeal to the laggard nation of us at
home.</p>

<p>The Englishwoman, the Belgian mother with her little
starving children, the French officer, the dying French
poilu&mdash;these were the foils for the actress, torn from her
stage by a message brought by one of the American
ambulance men to the hospital that her brother was
passing. It was her part to create the scene with which
to stir the blood, hers to cry to the French officer: &#8220;Why
are the Americans not here to prevent his dying? Did
not our Lafayette and his men go to them at their call?
Does America owe us nothing, then? See, he is only a
boy&mdash;too young to die! Could they not have made it
impossible?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Well, Fanny did it gloriously. All that had gone before
led up to her entrance, her gorgeous fur-lined cloak slipping
from her shoulders, her eyes imploring surgeon and nurses
to say that the boy was not yet gone. When she fell upon
her knees beside the cot where lay the limp figure of the
brother she was a figure to draw every eye and thought.
All the colour, all the light of the scene seemed to centre
in her, the bare hospital ward and the people in it turning
instantly to a dull background for her extravagant beauty,
her enchanting outlines, her anguish of spirit, her heroic
effort&mdash;after that one accusing cry&mdash;at composure. It
was impossible not to say that here was amateur acting
of a remarkable and compelling sort. If the pounding
heartbeats of the supposedly dying soldier under his torn
uniform might have been taken as an index of the pulses
of the audience, the general average must have been that
of high acceleration under the spell of Cary&#8217;s art and
Fanny&#8217;s cleverness.</p>

<p>Could it be called more than cleverness? Robert Black
was wondering, as he watched her from down in front.
Of course he watched her, he would have been hardly
human if he had not, or if he had not also come, for the
moment, at least, under her spell. Cleverness or real
dramatic power&mdash;it was difficult to judge, as it is always
difficult when the eyes are irresistibly attracted by fascination
of face and form. In her dress Fanny had copied
to the life the extravagantly revealing outlines of a certain
daring and popular vaudeville actress. When Nan Lockhart
had suggested that for the conservative American
suburb a trifle less frank a showing might be better taste
Fanny had laughed and shrugged her shoulders, and said
she didn&#8217;t intend to spoil the part by prudery. She vowed
that Cary Ray was the sort who would be furious with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
her if she came to his stage looking like a modest maiden
on her day of graduation from school! &#8220;He&#8217;s no infant
prodigy,&#8221; she had added, &#8220;he&#8217;s a full-grown man-genius,
and I&#8217;m going to play up to him. Just watch me get
away with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was getting away with it. Even Nan&mdash;who had
wanted to shake her from the moment of her first entrance
with that effect of being shyly reluctant to appear at all&mdash;had
to admit that Fanny had the audience in the hollow
of her pretty hand, not to mention the male portion of her
fellow actors, and, yes, even herself, as well. It was impossible
for Nan not to be fond of Fanny, and to forgive
her many of her sins, because of her personal charm and her
originality of speech and action. Whatever else she was,
no doubt but Fanny was always interesting. Generous
Nan was more than glad to have her friend distinguish
herself to-night, and looked on from her own unexacting
r&ocirc;le, with a full pride in Fanny&#8217;s achievement.</p>

<p>There arrived a moment in the play, however, when to
the discerning there came a sudden shifting of the honours.
It was almost at the last, when the scourging indictment
of the French actress had reached its height. It was then,
when the silence following her bitter cry had continued till
it had become painful, that the ambulance drivers and
the surgeon and nurse one by one came forward, till they
had surrounded the weeping Frenchwoman. Then the
nurse touched her on the shoulder:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame,&#8221; she said, &#8220;see. <i>We</i> are Americans!&#8221;</p>

<p>The actress looked up. The youngest of the drivers
was bending a little toward her&mdash;a tall, slim boy, with his
left sleeve torn, a long cut down his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a damned shame!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The other drivers clenched their fists, murmuring fierce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
assent. The surgeon drew his hand across his tired eyes&mdash;one
could see that they were blurred. The nurse, her eyes
deep and wonderful with pity, put her arm about the bare,
shaking shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;America will come,&#8221; she said&mdash;and her eyes seemed
to look across the sea. &#8220;She <i>must</i> come&mdash;and when she
does&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late&mdash;for him!&#8221; The actress&#8217;s hand pointed accusingly
at the still form on the cot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, too late for him. Too late for much&mdash;but not
too late for all. Meanwhile, Madame&mdash;<i>we</i> are here&mdash;<i>and
we care</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet we do!&#8221; It was the youngest driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your brother was a peach of a chap,&#8221; declared another,
and gently the audience down in front smiled while it wiped
its eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;A peasch?&#8221; Fanny&#8217;s little puzzled accent was perfect.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hero, Madame&mdash;the bravest of the brave,&#8221; the nurse
explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;I am content!&#8221; The gesture was superb.
The glittering eyes of the actress looked out over the
audience, then lowered suddenly, to rest for one instant
on Robert Black. It was an error, and a fatal one, if to
nobody but him. Up to that moment she had had him&mdash;at
that moment she lost him as an enthralled spectator.
The little self-conscious action broke the spell she had
woven. His gaze left her and rested upon Jane. And
there it found&mdash;what made him say to himself, suddenly
enraged with his own lack of discrimination:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I forgotten to watch <i>you</i>&mdash;in watching <i>her</i>?
Shame on me! She&#8217;s only acting. You are&mdash;<i>real</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes, through the remaining moments of the play,
never again left Jane. Now that the dazzling light no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
longer blinded his vision he could see the beauty which had
needed neither over-enhancing make-up nor ravishing
costume to set it forth. In the plain white of the nurse&#8217;s
dress, with the nun-like head-veil so trying in its austerity,
her face full of the exquisite compassion which is the hallmark
of the profession, Jane was now for him the central
figure. And when the actress had left the stage, the cot
with its still figure had been removed, and the five Americans
had returned for their final scene, the simple humanness
of it somehow &#8220;got over,&#8221; as the phrase is, so completely
that in its own way it far outshone the splendour
of the tragedy that had preceded it. And this was the
sure mark of Cary&#8217;s art, that he had dared to close with
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing that gets me&#8221;&mdash;it was the youngest ambulance
driver again&mdash;&#8220;is how the devil we&#8217;re ever going to
make &#8217;em see it back home&mdash;till it&#8217;s too late, same as she
said.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tired surgeon lifted his head. &#8220;I would go home
and make some speeches,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I could get away.
But if I go&mdash;who&#8217;ll do my job here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will take ten men,&#8221; said the nurse, simply.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and his grim smile touched his lips.
&#8220;Twenty nurses to fill your little shoes,&#8221; he retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Little</i> shoes?&#8221; The second ambulance driver looked
down at them. &#8220;They <i>are</i> darned little, but it <i>would</i> take
twenty nurses, at that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;America&#8217;s <i>got</i> to come!&#8221; spoke the third driver&mdash;a
fair-haired boy with a fresh, tanned face. &#8220;Gee, she&#8217;s <i>got</i>
to come, or I&#8217;ll turn Frenchman, for one. I can&#8217;t stand
it any longer. Money and munitions&mdash;and food&mdash;that&#8217;s
what they write&mdash;and we ought to be satisfied. Satisfied!
<i>Men</i>&mdash;why don&#8217;t they send <i>men</i>? Why don&#8217;t they <i>come</i>&mdash;millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of &#8217;em! Oh, it&#8217;s hell to have to be ashamed of
your own country!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will come!&#8221; It was the nurse. She stood up.
Her eyes looked out again across the seas. &#8220;I see her
coming.&#8221; She stretched out her arms. Behind her the
four men, the tired surgeon and the boyish ambulance
drivers, lifted their heads and stretched out their arms,
too. The girl&#8217;s voice rang out:</p>

<p>&#8220;O America!&mdash;<i>Come</i>&mdash;before it is forever too late!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The curtain fell. A murmur came from the audience&mdash;the
delayed applause rose, and rose again&mdash;then died away.
People got up, some triumphant, some uncertainly smiling,
others dark of brow. The young men beside Black were
aflame with the fire of that last challenge; their eyes looked
as if they were seeing new and strange things. When he
could get away from them Black pulled himself together,
dived through the orchestra door and came upon the
stage. He went first to Jane Ray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me take you home when you are ready?&#8221;
he asked, very low. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you&mdash;then.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded and turned away. He had seen her eyes&mdash;they
plainly showed that they had been wet with tears.</p>

<p>He shook hands with Cary Ray, who smiled at him,
and spoke rather deliriously. &#8220;We put it over, didn&#8217;t
we? You don&#8217;t have to tell me. I can read the human
countenance. Are you going to start across to-night&mdash;or
will morning do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You gripped us all, Cary. Don&#8217;t expect me to talk
about it&mdash;just yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;that&#8217;s enough. Here&#8217;s the girl who did
the trick.&#8221; And he put out his hands to Fanny Fitch.</p>

<p>Only Nan could have told how Fanny had done it, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
somehow already she had managed to get rid of so much
of her make-up as was intended to reach across the footlights,
and that which remained was not so perceptible
that it made her look the painted lady. She was a siren
now, was Fanny, and a dangerously happy one. The
effect of her had become that of a radiant girl who enjoys
a well-earned triumph, of which the great masses of orchids
and roses she was now carrying were the fitting sign.</p>

<p>&#8220;You scored a great success,&#8221; said Robert Black. He
was not afraid now to look at Fanny at close range; there
had been one moment in the play when he had thought he
might well be afraid, realizing acutely that he was only
human, after all, and had no stronger defenses than other
men. His glance met hers coolly. &#8220;I congratulate you
very heartily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad you liked me,&#8221; she answered, and her
voice was thrillingly low. &#8220;It means so much to me&mdash;to
please <i>you</i>! I was afraid I could never do that&mdash;your discrimination
is so fine. You would have known if I had
not really felt the part. I did&mdash;it seemed to me I simply
lived in that French actress&#8217;s body. It was a tremendous
experience really. I can never, never forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t she glorious?&#8221; Cary&#8217;s tense voice broke in.
He had not moved away. &#8220;I believe I must have written
the thing for her without ever having seen her. But
I&#8217;ve seen her now!&#8221; His fiery gaze devoured her, his thin
cheek flushed more deeply than before. Suddenly Black
was acutely aware of a new source of anxiety for Cary.
What would Fanny Fitch do with him, he wondered.
&#8220;Listen,&#8221; Cary went on hurriedly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have a
bit of a supper over at the hotel&mdash;this event has got to be
celebrated somehow. I&#8217;ve had Tom telephone over, and
they&#8217;ll get a few eats and things together for us in a hurry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Anyhow, we can work off a little of the high pressure that
way&mdash;and it&#8217;s got to be worked off, or a maniac like me
can&#8217;t keep his head till morning. You&#8217;ll join us, of course,
Mr. Black?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go over, and take your sister, but I can&#8217;t stay.
You won&#8217;t need me&mdash;and I haven&#8217;t been an actor, so I&#8217;m
naturally not in on it. Thank you just the same, Cary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing you&#8217;re in on it&mdash;nobody more so&mdash;we won&#8217;t
let you off. Nail him for me, will you, Miss Fitch?&#8221; and
Cary rushed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it will be no celebration at all without you!&#8221;
breathed Fanny Fitch, with a glance which would certainly
have turned Tom Lockhart crazy. Black felt himself
proof against it, even though his eyes told him that it was
worth getting if a man had a taste for that sort of thing.
She went on quickly: &#8220;You won&#8217;t make us&mdash;I don&#8217;t
mind saying you won&#8217;t make me, personally&mdash;so
unhappy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t be that, Miss Fitch, with all your
fellow actors to tell you how skillful your acting was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Skillful! Oh, but I don&#8217;t like that word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? All acting means skill, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;if you didn&#8217;t see more than that in it&mdash;I shall
be dreadfully hurt, Mr. Black. I meant to put&mdash;my
heart into it! It was such a wonderful play&mdash;it deserved
no less than that, did it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No less. And had no less from you all, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they were all splendid!&#8221; agreed Fanny, rallying
instantly to this call. &#8220;Miss Ray was perfect, especially.
Of course she had the glorious advantage of the last word&mdash;and
how effectively she used it! <i>There</i> was skill for you,
indeed. I didn&#8217;t know Miss Ray was so clever!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s generous of you,&#8221; said Black&mdash;and if there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
only a half-veiled irony in his tone now, Fanny didn&#8217;t
recognize it. The ambulance drivers were hovering close,
waiting for their chance. Black got away at length, and
it was with a curious sense of contentment that he listened
to something Mrs. Red Pepper Burns was saying
as he passed her: &#8220;Each one took his or her part tellingly,
but of course the honours rest with Miss Ray.
She didn&#8217;t act, she <i>was</i> that American girl summoning
us all. I can hear that last call yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My jolly, so can I!&#8221; Red&#8217;s lips shut together in a
tight line.</p>

<p>Black now did his best managing. He wasn&#8217;t specially
good at it, it being rather a new part for him to play,
where women were concerned. He was much more accustomed
to maneuvering to escape a too persistent encouragement
of his society than deliberately to planning
to get somebody to himself. His idea just now was that
if he could only take Jane away before the rest had started
for the hotel, a few blocks down the street, he might secure
the short walk with her alone. He had discovered that it
was raining, one of those late March rains which melt
the lingering snow from the streets, the air mild, the suggestion
of coming spring hinting strongly in the very feel
of the air. Cary was announcing that motors would soon
be at hand to take everybody&mdash;he wanted them all to remain
in costume, just for fun. Black must be quick now
if he would secure the thing he found he wanted very much
indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Ray, don&#8217;t you want to walk instead of ride?
I warn you that it&#8217;s raining, but wouldn&#8217;t the walk be good
for you, after all this heat and strain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane turned to him. She had put on a long belted coat
over her white uniform; she still wore her nurse&#8217;s veil-cap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; she answered, quickly. &#8220;It&#8217;s just what I
want most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come&mdash;now, if you can. I&#8217;ll tell Tom to explain
to your brother. He&#8217;ll forgive us&mdash;he&#8217;ll forgive anything
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>They slipped away, and only Red&#8217;s quick eye saw them
go. He said nothing to anybody&mdash;why should he? He
knew Robert Black too well, by now, not to understand
why he felt like getting away, and not to be entirely in
sympathy with his wanting to go with Jane Ray. He felt
like that himself&mdash;he didn&#8217;t want to go to anybody&#8217;s
supper party. But he knew that Cary must be allowed
to let down gradually to-night, and he knew that he was
the one to stand by, as he meant to do. Black had done
it far oftener than he.</p>

<p>Down in the street, with the first touch of the wet, mild
air upon her hot cheek, Jane drew a long, refreshed breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s so good,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? Somehow I knew it was what you needed
after that. Do you know what you did to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I did to anybody,&#8221; she said, &#8220;except
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked in silence, after these few words, for a full
block. Black held the umbrella low&mdash;it was a large umbrella,
and sheltered them both very well. He had offered
Jane his arm&mdash;it is difficult for two people to keep sufficiently
close together under an umbrella not to get wet
unless one takes the other&#8217;s arm. She had not taken it,
but she had gripped a fold of cloth on the under part of
his sleeve, and this held her securely in place. He could
just feel that slightest of contacts, and it gave him an odd
sense of comradeship.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>The silence was grateful to them both, as silence may be
between two people each of whom understands a good
deal of what the other is thinking. When Jane broke it,
at the end of the second block, it was with an unconscious
security that she could go on from where she had left
off, without explaining the gap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to go,&#8221; she said, in a tense voice. &#8220;I knew
that, when I took the part, or I couldn&#8217;t have dared to take
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you must be feeling that way. I understand.
So am I.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. &#8220;Oh! Shall you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in a sense bound to my church&mdash;until my first
year here is up, at least. It will be up in April. If war
isn&#8217;t declared by that time I shall go, whether the church
is willing to send me or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait,&#8221; said Jane, &#8220;till America is in, unless she
is in before I can get away. Cary can&#8217;t, either. He is
going to try to get a berth at once, as correspondent for his
old paper. He has sent them this play&mdash;it ought to
show them that he is&mdash;at work again and that&mdash;his brain
is clear. He&#8217;s physically pretty fit now, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great. And how will you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet&mdash;I&#8217;ll find a way. All I know is, I
can&#8217;t stand it another day not to be getting ready.
There&#8217;ll be some place for me&mdash;there must be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t question it.&#8221; He looked down at that sweet,
sturdy profile outlined now against the many lights of the
small downtown park they were passing. &#8220;Yes, they&#8217;ll
find a place for you. I wish I could be as sure of the one I
want.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;You?&#8221; Jane looked quickly up at him, and their eyes
met. &#8220;You want a commission?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I want a chaplaincy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Her tone showed deep disappointment. &#8220;I
knew you were all on fire about the war, but I did think
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would want a bigger job?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know of any,&#8221; he said, steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you feel that way&mdash;how can you? A chaplain
doesn&#8217;t bear arms&mdash;doesn&#8217;t go to the front&mdash;stays in
safe places&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her fingers let go of his sleeve, she
walked alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sort of chaplain I mean,&#8221; said Black&mdash;with a biting
sense of injury at his heart&mdash;&#8220;does bear arms. He
does go to the front. He never stays in safe places if
he can by any chance get out of them. Will you please&mdash;take
that back? I don&#8217;t think I can bear it&mdash;from
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him again, and again he looked down
at her. She saw the pain in his eyes, saw the virility in
his lean, strong face, the way his jaw set and his lips compressed
themselves in the line that speaks determination,
and was ashamed&mdash;and convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I take it back,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t be anything
but a fighting man wherever they put you. I ought to
know, by the way you have fought for my brother. Forgive
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a minute. Then he said slowly:
&#8220;The next time you come on a list of citations for distinguished
bravery, over there, would you mind reading
it carefully? And when you come to a chaplain&#8217;s name,
notice what he did to deserve it. That&#8217;s all I ask.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; Jane said softly. &#8220;I suppose I don&#8217;t know
the facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagine you don&#8217;t, Miss Ray.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re still angry with me. I can&#8217;t blame you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not angry. But I do care that the splendid fellows
over there who wear the cross on the collar of their tunic
should never be spoken of as if they were looking for safe
places. If I can take my place among them I&#8217;ll want no
higher honour&mdash;and no more dangerous work than they
take upon themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s fingers laid hold of the fold of his coat-sleeve
again. She bit her lip. Then she said gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked to be forgiven. Isn&#8217;t it a part of your office
to forgive the repentant?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was staring straight ahead, and this time it was she
who looked at a profile; stern and hard she thought it for
a minute. Then the set lips relaxed, and a deep breath
came through them. &#8220;I seem to care too much what you
think,&#8221; he acknowledged. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, I suppose,
what you do think. Never mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve apologized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t changed your feeling about it. I&#8217;m not
looking for a personal apology. It&#8217;s all right. Tell me&mdash;when
do you think you can get off?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane stopped short. The pair were in a side street,
and there were no pedestrians upon it within a considerable
distance. &#8220;Mr. Robert Black,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not go
another foot with you till you are friends with me again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friends with you?&#8221; He seemed to consider the question.
&#8220;Having once been your friend&mdash;how can I ever
be anything else&mdash;unless you tell me I can&#8217;t be? But
even friends can&mdash;fail to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fail to see. I see very clearly&mdash;quite suddenly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
And&mdash;if we are both going over, in the same cause, we
must keep on being friends. I think&mdash;&#8221; Jane&#8217;s voice
held a peculiar vibration&mdash;&#8220;I think, before I am through
with it, I may be very glad to have&mdash;a chaplain&mdash;for a
friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Black looked at her steadily for a moment. His
lips broke into a smile; she could see his splendid white
teeth between the pleasant lines. &#8220;Ah, you do make full
amends!&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&mdash;shall we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Then he
glanced up and down the street. He began to laugh.
&#8220;Where is that hotel?&#8221; he queried.</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s eyes scanned the street corners ahead and behind
them. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve gone by it,&#8221; she said, with
mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;let&#8217;s go a little farther by. Do you mind?
Mayn&#8217;t we go to that big building down there, before we
turn around? It&#8217;s not raining so very hard now. I hate
to take leave of you&mdash;just yet. It seems a poor place to
stop&mdash;when we&#8217;ve just got back to&mdash;the place we started
at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what was the place we started at?&#8221; She let him
take her forward again. He was walking more and more
slowly. It looked as if a good deal of time might possibly
be consumed before they should reach the designated
building and then retrace their steps to the patiently waiting
hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;The place where we were both going to war. Do you
realize what a meeting ground that is?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;It is&mdash;quite a meeting ground. It
seems to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated. He repeated the words
with the rising inflection. She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can finish it for you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It seems to&mdash;set us
apart, just a little&mdash;from the rest. At least&mdash;till they say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
they are going, too. Some of them will say that very soon.
Till they do&mdash;do you mind being&mdash;in a little clear space&mdash;just
with me&mdash;and with this big thing ahead to talk about
together?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a minute before Jane answered. When she did,
it was in the frankest, sweet way that she said straightforwardly,
&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mind, Mr. Black. I think I&mdash;rather
like it. You see, you&#8217;re not&mdash;poor company!&#8221;</p>

<p>Though they went on from there on that note of frank
friendliness, finished the walk, came finally to the hotel,
parted with the simplest sort of comradely good-night,
there could be no question that the bond between them,
till now established wholly on the basis of Black&#8217;s friendship
for Cary, had become something which was from Cary
quite apart. Whatever it was, it took Robert Black a
good three miles of walking alone in a rain which had all
at once become a downpour to think it out, and wonder,
with a quickening of the pulses, where it led.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>A LONG APRIL NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">&#8220;LET a fellow in? Oh&mdash;sorry! Did I wake you up?&#8221;
Black looked up, dazedly. It struck him that
Red didn&#8217;t appear particularly sorry, in spite of his brusque
apology. The red-headed doctor stood just within the
minister&#8217;s study door, bearing all the appearance of one
who comes on the wings of some consuming enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Black pushed a number of sheets of closely written paper
under a convenient magazine. He ran his hand across
his forehead, thrusting back dark locks more or less in disarray.
His eyes were undeniably heavy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in&mdash;do! Have a seat. Let me take your coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. You look in the dumps. Somebody been
flaying you alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black smiled a little wanly. &#8220;No. I rather wish they
had. It might give me something to think about. What
is it? You are full of some news&mdash;I can see that. Did
you do me the honour of coming to tell me about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Red laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s like you. Anybody else would
have left me to get around to it gradually, if he&#8217;d even
noticed that I seemed to be bursting with news. Well, I
am. And I had to blow off to somebody right now. Saw
your light and knew you were mulling over some self-appointed
task at this unholy hour. Thought it would probably
be good for you to turn your attention to a fellow-sufferer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Black&#8217;s sombre eyes rested intently on Red&#8217;s face. Red
had thrown his hat upon one chair, his motoring coat upon
another, and had seated himself astride of a straight and
formal manse chair, facing its back. His face was deeply
flushed; his eyes held all manner of excited lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re no sufferer,&#8221; was Black&#8217;s decision. &#8220;What is
it? You&#8217;re not&mdash;off for the war?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it. That&#8217;s exactly what I am. Had a
cable half an hour ago from my friend Leaver at the American
Hospital at N&mdash;&mdash;. He says come along as fast as
I can get there. He can use me, or have me sent to the front
line, as I prefer. If Jack Leaver says come, that settles it.
I&#8217;ll go as quick as I can get my affairs in order, take my
physical tests, have my inoculations, and put through my
passports. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great. Of course you&#8217;ll get to the front as fast as
possible&mdash;I know you. I congratulate you&mdash;heartily.&#8221;
Black got up and came over, his hand out. Red seized it.
He hung onto it, looking up into Black&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, too!&#8221; he challenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could. I can&#8217;t&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red dropped the hand&mdash;or would have dropped it if it
had not been withdrawn before he had the chance. He
scowled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t get the place I want till war is declared
and we begin to send men. I&#8217;ll wait for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means months, even if Congress loses no more
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know better. Our regulars will go mighty soon
after we declare war. I&#8217;ll find my place with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s the place you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black looked at him steadily. &#8220;You know, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Red nodded, grimly. &#8220;I suppose I do. Tom told me&mdash;but
I wouldn&#8217;t believe it. Look here, man! Give up that
fool notion that you&#8217;ve got to stick to your cloth, and go
in for a man&#8217;s job. Come over with me and enlist in one
of your Scottish regiments&mdash;that&#8217;s the place for you.
Then you&#8217;ll see the real thing. You&#8217;ve got the stuff in
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black&#8217;s face was going slowly white. &#8220;I&#8217;m an American.
When I go I&#8217;m going as chaplain of an American regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what damned rot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Red Pepper Burns was powerfully overwrought, or he
wouldn&#8217;t have said it. The next instant he realized what
he had said, for the lithe figure before him had straightened
and stiffened as if Red had brought the flat of his hand
against the other man&#8217;s cheek. At the same instant a
voice cold with wrath said with a deadly quiet command
in the ring of it: &#8220;Take that back, Doctor Burns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take back the word, if you like&mdash;but not the thought.
I can&#8217;t do that. A chaplaincy isn&#8217;t a man&#8217;s job&mdash;not a
young man&#8217;s job. Plenty of old priests and middle-aged
parsons to look after the dying. A good right arm like
yours should carry a rifle. I&#8217;d rather see you stay out of
it altogether than go in for the army-cut petticoats of
your profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then indeed Red saw a strange sight. He had seen
many men angry in his time; he now saw one angrier than
he would have believed possible without an outburst of
profanity. Black grew so pale he might have been going
to faint if the glitter in his black eyes hadn&#8217;t told the tale
of a vitality which was simply taking it out that way instead
of by showing red, as most men do. He opened his
lips once and closed them again. He raised his right hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
and slowly clenched it, looking down at it, while Red
watched him curiously. At last he spoke, in a strange,
low voice, still looking at that right hand of his:</p>

<p>&#8220;I never wanted anything in my life so much as to
knock you down&mdash;for that,&#8221; he said; and then his eyes
went from his clenched fist to look straight into Red&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do it? I give you leave. It <i>was</i> an
insult&mdash;I admit it&mdash;the second one. But I don&#8217;t take it
back. It&#8217;s what I think&mdash;honestly. If you don&#8217;t like it,
it&#8217;s up to you to prove yourself of a different calibre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red still sat astride of his chair, watching Black, whose
gaze had gone back to that right hand of his. He opened
and closed it again&mdash;and once more, and then he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Burns,&#8221; he said, slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have
to take this sort of thing from you&mdash;and I don&#8217;t think I
will.&#8221; He walked over to his study door, opened it, and
stood there waiting, like a figure cut out of stone. Red
leaped to his feet, his own eyes snapping.</p>

<p>&#8220;By jolly!&#8221; he shouted, seizing his hat and coat. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t have to be shown the door twice!&#8221; And he strode
across the floor. As he came up to Black the two pairs of
eyes met again. Anything sadder than the look now in
Black&#8217;s, overriding his anger, Red never had seen. It
almost made him pause&mdash;not quite. He went along out
and the door closed quietly behind him.</p>

<p>In the hall a plump, middle-aged figure was coming toward
him. Anxiety was written large on Mrs. Hodder&#8217;s
austerely motherly face. He would have gone by her
with a nod, but she put out a hand to stop him, and spoke
in a whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, Doctor, you cheered him up a little. Poor
man&mdash;I never saw him so down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red grunted. &#8220;No&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid I didn&#8217;t cheer him up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
much,&#8221; he admitted, gruffly. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t in any mood
to be cheered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed. A body can&#8217;t get over such news as he
had to-day in a hurry. He hasn&#8217;t eat a mouthful since he
heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Red paused, in the very act of pushing on
past her detaining hand. &#8220;Bad news, you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;didn&#8217;t he tell you? He told me. Two of
his sister&#8217;s sons are killed&mdash;and she only had three, and all
in this awful war. Killed almost together, they were.
He showed me their pictures&mdash;the likeliest looking boys&mdash;one
looks something like Mr. Black himself. Why, I
can&#8217;t think why he didn&#8217;t tell you, and him so terrible cut
up about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red wheeled, and looked back at the closed study door.
He looked again at Mrs. Hodder. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you told me,&#8221;
he said almost under his breath. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll&mdash;go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went back, pausing a minute at the door before he
opened it. Then he turned the knob softly, as if a very
sick patient were lying within. He went in noiselessly,
as doctors do, his eyes upon the figure seated again at the
desk, its head down upon its folded arms. He crossed
over to the desk, and laid his hand on Black&#8217;s right arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, lad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black raised his head, and now Red&#8217;s eyes saw what they
had not seen before&mdash;the ravages of a real grief. The red-headed
doctor was the possessor of rather the largest
heart known to man, and it was that heart which now took
command of his words and acts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know. Black,&#8221; Red repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Hodder told me. A curse on me for hitting you
when you were down.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>After a minute Black&#8217;s hand reached for the thin sheets
of closely written paper which he had pushed under the
magazine when Red had first entered. He looked them
over rapidly, then pointed to a paragraph. Red scanned
it as quickly as the unfamiliar handwriting would permit.
As he read he gave a low ejaculation or two, eloquent of
the impression made upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be proud of them,&#8221; he said, heartily. &#8220;And&mdash;they
were of your blood. I don&#8217;t think I need question
its virility. I guess I&#8217;d best leave it to you to decide what&#8217;s
your course&mdash;and not butt in with my snap judgments.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black looked up. &#8220;Thank you, Doctor Burns,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;for coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget what I said&mdash;will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can&mdash;right away. It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does matter&mdash;when you&#8217;re down and out with getting
a letter like that. If I hadn&#8217;t been so hot with my own
affairs I&#8217;d have seen for myself something&#8217;d happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Doctor.&#8221; Black rose wearily. &#8220;Some
day I&#8217;m going to make you think differently. Until
then&mdash;perhaps we&#8217;ll do better not to talk about it. I&#8217;m
glad you&#8217;re going&mdash;I envy you. Let&#8217;s let it go at that,
for to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red held out his hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ll shake hands?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow as he went away Red was feeling sorrier than
he would have believed possible that anything had happened
to make that handshake what he had felt it&mdash;a
purely formal and perfunctory one. Why had he said
those blamed mean things to Black about his profession,
he wondered. Confound his red head and his impudent
tongue! He liked Robert Black, liked him a lot, and better
and better all the time; trusted him, too&mdash;he realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
that. He had rushed into the manse study to-night from
a genuine impulse to tell his good news to the man from
whom he was surest of understanding and sympathy with
his own riotous joy over his great luck in getting the chance
to go across. And then he&#8217;d had to go and cut the fellow
where he was already wide open with his own private sorrow!
If there had been any way in which Red could have
made it up to his friend&mdash;yes, Black had become his friend,
no doubt of it, to rather an unanticipated degree&mdash;if there
had been any way in which he could have made it up to
him, taken the sting out of the hard words, and sent the
&#8220;lad&#8221; to bed feeling that somebody besides his housekeeper
cared that he was unhappy&mdash;well, Red would have
given considerable, as he went away, to have done
that thing. But there wasn&#8217;t any way. There hardly
ever is.</p>

<p>If he had known just what he left behind him, in that
manse study, undoubtedly Red would have been sorrier
yet&mdash;if he could have fully understood it. It is possible
that he could not just have understood, not having been
made of quite the same fibre as the other man. What he
would have understood, if he had chanced to see Black at
about the third watch of the night, would have been that
he was passing through some experience more tremendous
than that which any loss of kin could possibly have brought
him. The facts in the case were that, all unwittingly, Red
Pepper Burns, with a few hasty words, had brought upon
Robert Black the darkest hours he thus far had had to live
through.</p>

<p>It tackled him shortly after Red had left&mdash;the thought
which would not down&mdash;or, rather, the first of the two
thoughts, for there were two with which he had to wrestle
that long April night. It leaped at him suddenly, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
first thought, and in an instant, it had him by the throat.
Why not admit that Red was right, that the average
chaplaincy in the army or navy was a soft, safe job, and
not an honoured one at all? Why not let everything else
go, resign his church, go back to Scotland, look up men
of influence he knew there, and try for a commission?
Why not? Why not&mdash;&mdash; <i>Why not?</i></p>

<p>Would that mean that he would leave the ministry&mdash;permanently?
More than likely it would. Well, what if
it did? Could anything be better worth doing now than
offering his life in the Great War? Why stay here, preaching
flaming sentiment to a congregation who mostly
thought him overwrought upon the whole subject? Why
stay here, holding futile committee meetings, arguing
ways and means with hard-headed business men who
were everlastingly thinking him visionary and impractical?
Why go on calling on old ladies and sick people&mdash;christening
babies&mdash;reading funeral services&mdash;marrying people
who would more than likely be better single? Why go on
with the whole round of parish work, he, a man of military
age, a crack shot&mdash;he had not spent all those years in the
South for nothing!&mdash;possessed of a strong right arm, a
genius for leadership&mdash;when an older man could do all
these things for these people, and release him for work an
older man couldn&#8217;t do? And if he were free&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, it was here that his second temptation got in its
startling work. If he were free&mdash;he would be free to do
as other men did: marry a wife without regard to her
peculiar fitness to be&mdash;a minister&#8217;s wife! It wouldn&#8217;t
make any difference, then, if she never went to church,
had no interest in any of the forms of religious life, didn&#8217;t
read her Bible&mdash;didn&#8217;t even say her prayers when she went
to bed&mdash;didn&#8217;t do anything orthodox&mdash;as he was pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
sure somebody he knew didn&#8217;t. What did all that matter,
anyhow, so her heart was clean&mdash;as he knew it was!</p>

<p>Black pushed his revolving chair back from his desk so
violently that it nearly tipped over. He began to pace
up and down the study floor, his hands shoved deep into
his pockets, a tense frown between his brows. He walked
and walked and walked, getting nowhere in his mental
discussion precisely as he got nowhere in actual distance
with all that marching. And suddenly the similarity
between the two processes struck him, and he rushed into
the hall, seized hat and coat, put them on as a man does
who finds himself late for a train, and let himself out into
the April night where the air was heavy with a gathering
storm. It was precisely midnight by the sounding of a
distant tower clock as the manse door closed behind him.</p>

<p>Do you happen to know, by any analogous experience,
just what sort of a night Robert Black spent, alone with
himself? If you do, no need to describe it to you. If
you have never wrestled with a great spiritual temptation,
beating it off again and again only to have it steal up and
grip you more powerfully than before, then you can have
no conception of what that night brought to Black. A
concrete temptation&mdash;one to steal or rape or kill&mdash;can have
no comparison in insidiously disarming power with one
made up of forces which cannot be definitely assigned to
the right side or the wrong. When the thing one wants to
do can be made to seem the right thing, when Satan masks
as an angel of light, and only a faint inner voice tells one
insistently that his premises, his deductions, his conclusions,
are every one false, then indeed does the struggle become
a thing of increasing torture, compared with which
physical distress is to be welcomed.</p>

<p>It was four in the morning when Black let himself into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the manse again, the light in his study seeming to him the
only light there was left in the whole world, and that dim
and unilluminating enough. Outside a heavy storm of
wind had disabled the local electric service, and the streets
for the last two hours had been dark as Erebus&mdash;and as
Black&#8217;s own thoughts. He had been grateful for that
darkness for a time; then suddenly it had oppressed him
unbearably and he had fled back to his home as swiftly as
he had left it. There&mdash;there, in the room where he was
used to think things out, was the place for him to come to
his decision.</p>

<p>As he came in at the manse door the lights flashed on
again. It was undeniably warm and bright there in his
study, but his heavy heart took no comfort from this.
It was a physical relief to be inside out of the storm, but
the storm in his soul abated not a jot at sight of the
familiar place. The very look of the study table, filled
with matters of one sort or another pertaining to his work&mdash;his
writing pad, his loose-leaf notebook, his leather
sermon-holder, the row of books with which he had lately
been working and which were therefore lined up between
heavy book-ends for convenience in laying his hand
upon them&mdash;somehow the sight of these gave him a sense
of their littleness, their futility, compared with the things
he had been seeing as he walked. A rifle, with a bayonet
fixed and gleaming at its end; a Scottish uniform, with
chevrons on the sleeve and insignia on the shoulder&mdash;a
worn, soiled uniform at that; men all about, real men, who
did not fuss over trifles nor make too much of anything,
men with whom he could be friend or enemy as he desired&mdash;these
were what Black saw. He saw also the two brave
lads who had gone to their death, his own blood, who had
been coming over shortly to follow his lead in the big country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
where he had found room to breathe, and whose untimely
end he longed personally to avenge. And he saw&mdash;Jane
Ray, over there, herself in service, meeting him
somewhere, when both had done their part, and joining
her life with his in some further service to mankind,
social, reconstructive, unhampered by the bonds of any
religious sect&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, well&mdash;perhaps you can&#8217;t see or feel it&mdash;perhaps to
you the logical thing seems the very thing that so called
to Robert Black. Why shouldn&#8217;t he listen&mdash;why shouldn&#8217;t
he respond&mdash;why wasn&#8217;t this the real thing, the big thing,
and why shouldn&#8217;t he dare to take it, and give God thanks
that He had released him from too small, too cramped, too
narrow a place of usefulness, into one which was bounded
only by the edges of the great world of need? What
was it that held him back&mdash;that so hardly held him
back?</p>

<p>It was a little black-bound book which first began to
turn the tide. It was lying on the study desk, pushed well
back under some loose papers, but it was there all the time,
and Black never once lost the remembrance that it was
there. Again and again he wished it were not there, because
he knew through it all that he could never settle the
thing without reference to that little worn book. It was
not the Bible, it was a ritual-book, containing all the forms
of service in use in the Church to which Black belonged;
it held, among others, the service for the ordination of
ministers, and that very book had been used in the ordination
of Black himself. As a man fighting to free himself
from his marriage vows might struggle to turn his thoughts
away from the remembrance of the solemn words he had
once spoken, so did Black, in his present mood, strive to
forget the very nearness at hand of that little book. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
yet, at last, as he had known he would, he seized and
opened it. After all, were such vows as he had made
irrevocable? Many a man had forsaken them, first and
last. Had none of these deserters been justified?</p>

<p>Yet, as he went over and over it, that which hit him so
heavily was not the language of the ordination vows which
he had been evading and which now struck him full in
his unwilling conscience, gravely binding though the
phrases were. Nor was it that of the closing prayer, well
though he remembered how the words had thrilled him,
and had thrilled him ever since, whenever he read them
over: &#8220;<i>Endue him with spiritual grace; help him perform
the vow that he has made; and continuing faithful unto death
may he at length receive the crown of life which the Lord,
the righteous Judge, will give him in that day.</i>&#8221; No, it
was not these words which held his reluctant gaze fast at
last, but others, which he had written into the small
blank space at the top of the page whereon the service
began.</p>

<p>Two years before he had had sudden and unexpected
word of his mother&#8217;s death on Easter Day&mdash;and the approaching
Sunday would be Easter again. On that day,
because she had been dear to him, and because he had been
across the seas from her, he had written upon the page
a renewal of his ordination vows. When he had been a
little boy she had told him that some day she wanted him
to be a minister of the Scottish Church, the Free Kirk of
Scotland, in which she had been brought up. It had hurt
her that he had wanted to go away to America, and though
he had several times during the succeeding years crossed
the ocean to see her, she had never quite recovered from
the disappointment. On a strange impulse, that Easter
Day, two years ago, knowing that he could never in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
world see her face again, he had taken up his pen and
written upon the blank space these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Beloved Mother</span>:</p>

<p>This is the most precious thing I have in the world. I give it
to you this Easter Day of your entrance into Heaven. These
words were used at my ordination. I have said them over again
to-day, because of your love for me, and my love for you. I shall
keep them always.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Robert.</span></p>
</div>

<p>These, then, were the irrevocable words he could not
take back. He had vowed to his God&mdash;he had promised
his mother&mdash;&mdash; How shall a man take back such words?
He had known all along it was unthinkable that he should,
but his fight had been none the less tremendous for that&mdash;perhaps
the more, for that. The tighter one feels the
bonds that bind him, the harder is the struggle against
them.</p>

<p>Black fell upon his knees before the old red-cushioned
rocker which still held its place among the more dignified
furnishings of the study. Somehow, it was this chair
which was to him his Throne of Grace. He had not yet
given up&mdash;it seemed to him he couldn&#8217;t give up&mdash;but he
had come to this, that he could take the attitude of prayer
about it, instead of striding blindly through the silent
streets, his own fierce will driving him on. And even as
he knelt, there came before him with new and vivid colour,
like a fascinating portrait on a screen, the face of Jane Ray.
Thus far, to-night, he had succeeded mostly in keeping her
in the background, at least till he should have decided his
great question. But with her sudden return to the forefront
of his mental images came a new and startling
thought: &#8220;If you went as she wants you to go, you might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
marry her before you went. You might go together.
But as a chaplain&mdash;you can only be her friend. Make
love to her&mdash;wild love, and take her off her feet! Be
human&mdash;you&#8217;ve every right.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this he fairly leaped to his feet. And then began
the very worst conflict of all, for this last thought was more
than flesh and blood could stand. In his present mood,
the exhaustion of the night&#8217;s vigil beginning to tell heavily
against his endurance, he was as vulnerable as mortal
could well be. Since the night when he had seen Jane
act in Cary&#8217;s play and had taken her for the walk in the
rain, her attraction for him had grown apace. He had
not understood quite how it had grown till Red&#8217;s words
to-night had set his imagination aflame. The vision of
his going soldiering had somehow kindled in him new
fires of earthly longing, dropping his priesthood out of
sight. Now, suddenly, he found himself all but a lover,
of the most human sort, thinking with pulses leaping of
marriage in haste, with the parting which must inevitably
soon follow keying the whole wonderful experience to the
highest pitch. It was the sort of imagining which, once
indulged in for a moment, goes flying past all bounds and
barriers, while the breath quickens and the blood races,
and the man is all man, with other plans, other hopes, other
aspirations forgot, in the rush of a desire so overwhelming
that he can take no account of anything else in heaven or
earth.</p>

<p>Small wonder, then, that Black should find he must have
it out with himself all over again, nothing settled, even
the little black-bound book in one mad moment dropped
into a drawer and the drawer slammed shut. Not fair&mdash;<i>not
fair</i>&mdash;to have to keep that book in sight! God Himself
knew, He must know, that when He made man he made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
him full of passions&mdash;for all sorts of splendid things&mdash;and
perhaps the greatest of these were war&mdash;and love! How
should a man be satisfied to be&mdash;a priest? No altar fire
could burn brightly enough for him to warm his cold hands.
As for his heart&mdash;it seemed to him just then that no
priest&#8217;s heart could ever be warm at all!</p>

<p>Could it not? Even as Black raged up and down his
room, his hands clenched, his jaw hard set, his eyes fell
upon a picture in the shadow&mdash;one he knew well. There
had been a time when that picture had been one of his
dearest possessions and had hung always above his desk.
When he had come to his new church, and had been setting
his new study in order, Tom had helped him hang his few
pictures. It had been Tom who, glancing critically at
this one, and seeing in it nothing to himself appealing&mdash;it
was to him a dim and shadowy thing, of little colour and
no significance&mdash;had hurriedly placed it over here, in this
unlighted corner. Several times since Black had noted it
there, and had said to himself that it was a shame for the
beautiful thing to be so obscured&mdash;he must remove it to
a better place and light, because he really cared much for
it. But he had been busy&mdash;and careless&mdash;he had not
removed it. And now, suddenly, it drew him. He
went to it, took it from the wall, went over to the desk
light with it. And then, as he looked, once again the miracle
happened, and the spirit, the spirit which God Himself
has set in every human creature, leaped up and triumphed
over the flesh, and Black&#8217;s fight was over&mdash;for that time.
Not over forever, perhaps, but over for that time&mdash;which
was enough.</p>

<p>Perhaps you know the picture&mdash;it is well known and
much loved. A great cathedral nave stretches away into
the distance, the altar in the far background streaming with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
light, the choir gathered, the service on. The foreground
of the picture is all in shadow, and in the depths of that
shadow kneels one prostrate form in an abandon of
anxiety or grief. Behind it, unseen, stands a wondrous,
pitying, strongly supporting figure with hand outstretched,
an aura of light about it, love and understanding emanating
from it. Not with the crowd at the altar, but with
the lonely human creature in the darkness, lingers the
figure of the Lord. The words below are these: &#8220;<i>Lo, I
am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Black dropped upon his knees once more before
the old red-cushioned chair, but not, now, with will rebellious
against a too hard fate, a too rigorous necessity.
The old loyalty, at sight of the picture which in past days
of happy faith had meant so much to him, had sprung into
life again as a flame, quenched but not put out, springs as
the wind fans it. A sob came into his dry throat, his head
went down upon his folded arms. His body relaxed;
after a minute he no longer knelt, he had sunk upon the
floor with his face pillowed against the red cushion in the
chair-seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;O my Christ!&#8221; he said slowly aloud, &#8220;I give up. I
couldn&#8217;t do it for God&mdash;but I can for You! It was You I
promised&mdash;I&#8217;ll keep it&mdash;till the end! If I go to war, I&#8217;ll
go to carry&mdash;Your Cross! And if You&#8217;ll let me, I&#8217;ll carry
it to the very front!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodder found him in the morning&mdash;though it was
morning indeed when the fight was over. He had been
asleep but an hour, there on the floor by the old red rocker,
when she came briskly in to open the windows and give
the manse study its usual early dusting and setting to
rights. At sight of the desk light still burning dully in the
pale daylight she looked astonished, and a moment later,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
as she espied the figure on the floor by the chair, she
started, frightened. Trembling she called the minister&#8217;s
name, stooping over him; but seeing at once the warm
colour in his cheek, drew back with an agitated breath of
relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;My land!&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;if the poor dear man ain&#8217;t
so beat out he&#8217;s went to sleep right here on the floor. I
always did know he&#8217;d kill himself if he kept rushin&#8217; around
so, tryin&#8217; to be all things to all men&mdash;and all women.
Seems like they couldn&#8217;t think of enough things to ask
him to do for &#8217;em, besides all the things he thinks of himself.
That bad news he got, too&mdash;likely that was what
used him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered a very sleepy voice, when she had
shaken the recumbent shoulder a little and called his name
once or twice, &#8220;all right. Breakfast ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet&mdash;but &#8217;twill be, in a jiffy. Goodness me, Mr.
Black, you certainly did give me a start! You must have
been tired to death, to sleep all night on the floor, so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black got stiffly to his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right. Listen&mdash;what&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an early morning newsboy on the street outside,
stridently calling: &#8220;<i>Extry&mdash;extry!&mdash;&mdash;</i>&#8221; What followed
was not distinguishable. Black, overcoming his stiffness
of limb in a hurry, got to the outer door, whistled loudly,
and secured a paper. When he came back all appearance
of sleep or weariness had fled from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in, Mrs. Hodder, we&#8217;re in!&#8221; he was half shouting,
and his tone thrilled his middle-aged housekeeper. Long
afterward she was accustomed to say, when she told the
story: &#8220;I knew from that minute where <i>he&#8217;d</i> be. We&#8217;d
ought all have known it from the beginning, but I was so
dumb I never sensed it till that morning when he come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
back with the paper, callin&#8217; out so solemn&mdash;and yet so
happy-like&mdash;&#8216;<i>We&#8217;re in, Mrs. Hodder, we&#8217;re in!</i>&#8217; says he.
I guess he <i>was</i> in! That was a Saturday. And Sunday&mdash;he
gave us the sign! My, but I&#8217;ll never forget that!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sign! Yes, that was what Black did give. All day
Saturday he was making possible the thing he had long
before determined he would do when the hour came. From
mill to shop he went, with orders and measurements; late
on Saturday evening he came out of the Stone Church alone,
locking the door behind him. His face was worn but not
unhappy, and that night he slept like a tired child, his
cheek upon his hand, his heart quiet and steady in his
breast.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the people came into church, every
eye turned startled to one spot. At the right of the pulpit,
on the floor just below, lifted a straight and sturdy standard.
From it hung the American flag, its silken folds
motionless in the still air, yet seeming alive in the glory of
its vivid colour. Above it hung the only flag which held
the right to hang above the National emblem&mdash;that of the
Church Militant, the pure white pennant with its cross
of blue.</p>

<p>In a brief service Robert Black, his face showing red and
white by turns with a restrained emotion he could not
wholly conceal, dedicated the two flags, and his people
had their first glimpse of what it might mean to him and
them before it should all be over and peace again upon the
earth. They couldn&#8217;t know that to him the real dedication
of the two flags had taken place the night before, when
alone in the church he had lifted them into place and knelt
before them, vowing anew his vow of allegiance and of
service to God and country, a vow never again to be
insecure upon his lips.</p>

<small>EVERYBODY PLOTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MAY I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan Lockhart hardly paused for permission to
enter Fanny&#8217;s room, so accustomed was she to share intimately
with her friend most of her possessions, including
rooms. Therefore she followed her knock and question
with her entrance&mdash;and paused upon the threshold with a
boyish whistle of surprise not unmixed with derision.</p>

<p>Fanny turned away from the long mirror with a
little laugh. &#8220;Well, how do you like me in it?&#8221; she
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re stunning, of course,&#8221; Nan admitted.
&#8220;Trying on all the different forms of war service, to see
which is most becoming? You&#8217;ll let that decide it, of
course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Miss Cynic! And why not? Shouldn&#8217;t a
girl make the most of herself, under all conditions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny had donned a white blouse and skirt, white shoes
and stockings, and had pinned a white towel about her
head. She had even gone to the trouble of cutting out a
small red cross and fastening it upon the front of her head-gear.
The towel did not entirely cover her hair; engaging
ringlets showed themselves about her small ears. She
resembled a fascinating young nun except that in her
eyes danced a most unconventional wickedness.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is merely stage play, I suppose?&#8221; Nan questioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
dryly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no possible thought of offering your
services, in towels or out of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny Fitch swung herself up to the footboard of her
bed, and sat there, swinging her pretty feet. She smiled
at her friend disarmingly; but Nan did not disarm under
the smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the most distrustful creature I ever knew,
Nancy Lockhart. Don&#8217;t you think I could get away with
the nursing proposition? Smooth the fevered brow, and
count the throbbing pulse, and charm the disordered brain
back to sanity and calm? Read aloud to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And wade around in floods of gore, and scrub the floor
of the operating room, and keep on working when your
back aches like fury, and get about four hours&#8217; sleep out
of twenty-four? Wear your white uniform with the ward
below fifty degrees&mdash;and zero outside? Game, are you,
Fanny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&mdash;how terribly technical you sound!
What do you know about it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than you do, I&#8217;ll wager. I&#8217;ve been reading
about an American girl who has been in it for two years
already. She &#8216;<i>wears the rue&mdash;with a difference</i>,&#8217; methinks,
Fanny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to get in it somehow,&#8221; announced
the wearer of the pseudo-uniform frankly. &#8220;Because, you
know, my friend Robert Black is going, and I can&#8217;t think
with serenity of the wide Atlantic rolling between us. Of
course there&#8217;s just one way I&#8217;d like to go, and maybe I&#8217;ll
achieve that yet.&#8221; Her eyes sparkled. &#8220;Ye gods,
but wouldn&#8217;t that be great! What&#8217;ll you wager I go&mdash;that
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As his&mdash;well&mdash;&#8221; Fanny seemed to be enjoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
herself intensely&mdash;&#8220;as his comrade-at-arms, you know&mdash;meaning,
of course, his&mdash;comrade <i>in</i> arms. Oh-h!&#8221;&mdash;she
gave the exclamation all the dramatic force it could
hold, drawing it out with an effect of ecstasy&mdash;&#8220;Think
of walking away with Robert McPherson Black from
under the very eyes of his congregation&mdash;and of the demure
but intriguing Jane!&#8221; And she threw both arms wide
in a gesture of abandon, then clasped them across her
breast, slipped down from the footboard, and fell at
Nan&#8217;s feet, looking up at her with beseeching eyes and an
utter change of aspect. &#8220;Oh, please, my dearest dear,
don&#8217;t put any spokes in my wheel! Let me just imagine
I&#8217;m doing something to bridge the chasm&mdash;the enormous
chasm between us. It&#8217;s a frightful thing to be so deeply,
darkly, desperately in love as I am&mdash;and then to see your
hero absorbed in plans to take himself away from you, out
of your world, with never a look behind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I&#8217;ll <i>make</i> him look behind&mdash;I will&mdash;I will!
I&#8217;ll turn those rapt black eyes of his back to the earth,
earthy&mdash;or to the United States, United States-y&mdash;and to
Fanny Fitch. And&mdash;I&#8217;ll keep Jane Ray home if I have
to put poison in her food.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny, get up!&#8221; Nan reached down and shook her
friend&#8217;s shoulders. &#8220;What on earth is the matter with
you? Have you gone crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221; Fanny buried her head in Nan&#8217;s skirts,
clasping her arms about the other&#8217;s waist. &#8220;Raving
crazy. I met Mr. Black on the street just now. He was
rushing along with his wagon hitched to a star, by the
look of him. He didn&#8217;t even see me till he all but ran
into me. Of course I had put myself in his way. Then
he snatched off his hat, asked pardon and how I was, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
in the same breath&mdash;as if I had been one of his very oldest
old ladies&mdash;and got away like a catapult. He was going
in the direction of the station, I admit, but that wouldn&#8217;t
reasonably have prevented his exchanging a few friendly
words with me. Oh, I can stand anything&mdash;anything&mdash;but
having a man not even see me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I should judge, my dear, from past experience,&#8221;
Nan commented, grimly. She had put her arms rather
reluctantly about Fanny, however; it was impossible not
to see that something, at least, of this hysteria was caused
by real feeling, if amazingly undisguised. She was quite
accustomed to Fanny&#8217;s self-revelations, and entirely used
to taking them without seriousness. But in the present
instance her sympathies were supplemented by her understanding
of how it might be quite possible for a girl to lose
her head over Robert Black without his being in the least
responsible by personal word or deed. She now endeavoured
to apply a remedy to the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Mr. Black isn&#8217;t thinking about
anything just now but war, and how to get across. He
has lost those fine young nephews, whom he expected to
have come here when the war was over, and his mind is
full of them. He hasn&#8217;t a corner of his attention to give
to women&mdash;any woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met him twice in the last week coming out of
Jane Ray&#8217;s. Of course Cary was with him one of the
times, and Doctor Burns the other&mdash;but that doesn&#8217;t
mean he hadn&#8217;t been confabbing with Jane. He&#8217;s wise
as a serpent, but I&#8217;m not at all sure he&#8217;s harmless as a dove&mdash;he&#8217;s
much too clever to be seen paying attentions to
any of us. He&#8217;s always with some man&mdash;you can&#8217;t get
at him. And when he comes here he has Tom hanging
round him every minute. Of course I know Tommy wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
to keep him away from me&mdash;but he appears to want to
be kept away, so I can&#8217;t so much as get a chance. If I
could&mdash;&mdash; But&mdash;I <i>will</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny sat back on her heels, wiping away a real tear
with the corner of her towel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you will, if you set out to do it. But&mdash;be
careful, my dear. Robert Black can&#8217;t be taken by storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one way he can be taken. I might plot and
plan forever to make an impression on him in the ordinary
ways&mdash;he&#8217;s steel proof, I think, against those. The only
way to get his attention is the way this war has got it&mdash;by
shot and shell. If I can just somehow be badly
wounded and fall down in his path, he&#8217;ll&mdash;stoop and pick
me up. And if he once finds me in his arms&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Fanny, Fanny! For heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t try to
play a game with him!&#8221; Nan spoke sternly. She removed
herself by a pace or two from her friend, and stood
aloof, her dark brows drawing together. &#8220;I know you&#8217;re
a born actress and can assume any part you like. That
may be well enough in ordinary times&mdash;though I doubt it&mdash;but
not in times like these. Don&#8217;t go to war to play
the old game of hitting hearts. You&#8217;re not going to war&mdash;I
know that&mdash;but don&#8217;t pretend you want to. It isn&#8217;t
fair. This thing is one of life or death, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s
taking men like Doctor Burns and Mr. Black into it.
They&#8217;ll have no use for anybody who doesn&#8217;t offer himself,
body and soul. That&#8217;s what Jane Ray is doing&mdash;but
not you, you know. You just want&mdash;to marry a
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you&#8217;re hard!&#8221; Fanny got to her feet, moved
over to the window and stood looking out, the picture of
unhappiness. &#8220;Jane Ray, indeed! How does it happen
you believe in her so fast? Why isn&#8217;t she playing a game,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
too?&mdash;Of course she is. But because her hair is smooth
and dark, and her manner so sweetly poised, you take her
at her own valuation. She&#8217;s clever as Satan, and she&#8217;ll
put it over, I suppose. But why, just because I&#8217;m of a
different type, I must be forever accused of acting&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear&mdash;I&#8217;m taking <i>you</i> at your own valuation.
Haven&#8217;t you explained to me exactly the part you intend
to play&mdash;getting badly wounded and falling down in
Robert Black&#8217;s path&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so intensely literal!&#8221; Fanny spoke bitterly.
&#8220;Heaven knows it will be no acting if I do get wounded.
I&#8217;m wounded now&mdash;to the heart. And if I fall down in
his path it&#8217;ll be because I can&#8217;t stand up. Last Sunday,
when he stood there under the colours&mdash;who <i>wouldn&#8217;t</i>
have wanted him? Why, even you&mdash;&#8221; she turned to
look full at Nan, with her reddened eyes searching Nan&#8217;s
grave face&mdash;&#8220;it wouldn&#8217;t take an awful lot of imagination
to put you in the same class with me, in spite of that
wonderful grip you always keep on yourself. Honestly,
now, can you tell me you wouldn&#8217;t marry him, if he asked
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annette Lockhart was not of those who turn scarlet or
pale under cross-examination. Moreover, she was the
daughter of Samuel Lockhart and had from him the ability
to keep close hold of her emotions. She was entirely
accustomed to facing down Fanny Fitch when she did not
choose to reveal herself to her. Nevertheless, it may have
cost her the effort of her life to answer neither too vehemently
nor too nonchalantly this highly disconcerting
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly must be a little mad to-day, my dear
girl. Just because you are so hard hit, don&#8217;t go to fancying
that the woods are full of the slain. I like Mr. Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
very much, but I&#8217;m not a case for the stretcher-bearers&mdash;nor
likely to be. And just now I&#8217;m wanting so much to
go myself, and know I can&#8217;t possibly, because Tom will,
and Father and Mother couldn&#8217;t face our both going at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny began suddenly to get out of her white apparel.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going round to see Jane Ray,&#8221; she announced, with
one of the characteristic impulses to whose expression Nan
was well used. &#8220;It&#8217;s best to make friends with the enemy
in this case, I think. And possibly I may meet Robert
Black&mdash;coming out or going in under cover of a man friend.
In that case I may receive one casual glance from His
Eminence which will complete my undoing for to-day.
That will surely be worth while.&#8221; She laughed unhappily.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward she walked into Jane Ray&#8217;s
shop. Her eyes were red no longer, her colour was charming,
her manner was composed. When Jane was at
liberty Fanny discussed &#8220;pie-crust&#8221; tables with her, declaring
her intention to present something of the sort to
Mrs. Lockhart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made such a terribly long visit,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;and still they urge me to stay on. Of course it&#8217;s wonderful
for me&mdash;with my mother so far away. But I shall only
stay till I can find out where to offer myself&mdash;if mother will
just say I may go. Poor dear, she has such a horror of war&mdash;she
may make it difficult for me. Meanwhile&mdash;I want to
take every possible step, so I can have every argument to
meet her with. If I could only go with someone&mdash;some
other girl&mdash;she might feel differently about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should think that might help it,&#8221; Jane agreed.
Her dark eyes met Fanny&#8217;s lustrous blue ones across the
group of tables they had been considering. She was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
much on her guard now wherever Miss Fitch was concerned.
The problem of the friendship between Nan
Lockhart, whom Jane couldn&#8217;t help liking and thoroughly
trusting, and Fanny Fitch, whom she could somehow
neither like nor trust, was one which she had as yet found
no means of solving. Also, Cary&#8217;s sudden and intense
interest in Fanny had set his sister to studying the girl
with new acuteness. Thus far she seemed to Jane all
actress; it was becoming increasingly difficult not to suspect
her constantly of being other than she seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet we all act, more or less,&#8221; Jane said to herself
honestly. &#8220;I&#8217;m acting this very minute, myself. I&#8217;m
playing the part of one who is only politely interested in
what she means to do, while I&#8217;m really crazily anxious that
she shall not do certain things which involve Cary and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you would trust me with any of your own
plans,&#8221; Fanny said, engagingly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help knowing
that you mean to go, and I&#8217;m sure you must have much
real knowledge that I&#8217;m ignorant of. Is nursing the only
thing a girl can do? You&#8217;re not trained for that, are
you? Forgive me&mdash;I&#8217;m not just curious, you know&mdash;I&#8217;m
tremendously serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My plans aren&#8217;t fully worked out,&#8221; Jane answered.
&#8220;I have enough training to go as nurse&#8217;s assistant, under
the Red Cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, have you? How wonderful! Could I get that,
do you suppose? I&#8217;m really a terribly quick study&mdash;I
used to cram any amount of stuff in the forty-eight hours
before an exam, and get away with it. If I could&mdash;oh,
Miss Ray&mdash;would it be possible&mdash;would you be willing&mdash;<i>could</i>
you consider letting me go with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane looked into the sea-blue eyes which were looking
so appealingly into her own. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said to herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
again, &#8220;I can see exactly how you do it. That look is
absolutely irresistible&mdash;just angel-sweet and full of sincerity.
I wish I could trust you&mdash;I really wish I could. But
somehow&mdash;I can&#8217;t. Something inside me says that you
don&#8217;t mean it&mdash;you don&#8217;t&mdash;you&#8217;re not genuine. You&#8217;ve
some stake you&#8217;re playing for&mdash;you don&#8217;t care a copper
cent about helping over there. How am I going to deal
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s odd, isn&#8217;t it? How do we do it&mdash;how do we keep
up this double discussion, one with our lips, the other with
our thoughts? Jane and Fanny went into the matter
rather thoroughly, talking with entire friendliness of
manner about possible courses to be followed, sources of
information to be consulted; and all the time the things
they both were thinking ran so far ahead in volume
and in direction of the things they were saying that there
could be no comparison between the two. Both were
much too well trained in worldly wisdom to allow the
smallest particle of personal antagonism to show in word
or manner, and yet as the talk proceeded each became more
and more aware that there was and could be no sympathy
or openness between them.</p>

<p>And then Cary came dashing into the shop, and seeing
Fanny pounced upon her and bore her away with him for
a walk, vowing he should so soon be gone he must make
the most of every opportunity. Jane looked after them
as they went, wishing heartily that the day would come
quickly when Cary would be off and away. His plans
were rapidly taking shape; his old newspaper, after a
searching interview with him and a series of inquiries
directed toward establishing the thoroughness of his reformation,
had made him a sort of probational offer which he
had accepted with mingled glee and resentment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;They&#8217;ll send me, only with all kinds of conditions
attached which I&#8217;d never accept if I weren&#8217;t so wild to go.
But they&#8217;ll see&mdash;I&#8217;ll show them. Just let me send back
one rattling article from the real front, and they&#8217;ll be wiring
to tie me up to the thing for the duration of the war.&#8221;
Thus he had exultantly prophesied to his sister, and to
Robert Black, and to Red, and they had agreed that it was
certainly up to him. He had his chance&mdash;the chance to
retrieve himself completely; they were all three concernedly
eager to see him safely off upon his big adventure.</p>

<p>He was so excited about it, so restless, so impatient for
the call which had been virtually promised him for an
early date, that they felt constrained to watch him carefully.
Without knowing exactly why, none of these
three friends quite liked to see him often with Fanny Fitch.
Jane herself was unwilling to appeal to Fanny, or to give
her even a vague idea of his past weakness; she now saw
them go away together with an uneasy feeling that she
wished it hadn&#8217;t happened.</p>

<p>An hour later Cary telephoned that he wouldn&#8217;t be back
for dinner; he would take it in town, he said&mdash;he had some
equipment to look up. He might be back late&mdash;Jane was
not to sit up for him. He said nothing about Miss Fitch,
but Jane&#8217;s instant conviction was that the two were dining
together. Probably they would go to the theatre afterward
and come out on a late local. Well, what of it?
Fanny was no schoolgirl to need chaperonage; there was
nothing in this program to disturb anybody. But Jane
was disturbed. Suppose&mdash;well, suppose Fanny were the
sort of girl who didn&#8217;t object to having a cocktail&mdash;or a
glass of champagne&mdash;or both&mdash;at a hotel dinner alone
with a man? What would companionship on that basis
do for Cary, just now? She had no reason to suppose that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
Miss Fitch was that sort of girl, and yet&mdash;somehow&mdash;she
felt that the chances were in favour of her being precisely
that sort of girl. Nan Lockhart&#8217;s friend&mdash;wasn&#8217;t that
voucher enough? Still, friends didn&#8217;t always know each
other as well as they supposed they did. And Fanny,
ever since she had dressed the part of the French actress
with such fidelity to fact, had seemed to Jane an over-sophisticated
young woman who wouldn&#8217;t much mind
what she did, so that she drew men&#8217;s eyes and thoughts to
herself. Excitement&mdash;that was what Fanny wanted,
Jane was sure. An excellent chance for it, too, dining
with a brilliant young war-correspondent, himself keyed
to high pitch over his near future. And if the play
chanced to be&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A certain recollection leaped into Jane&#8217;s brain. She
went hurriedly to the back of the shop for the city daily,
and scanned a column of play offerings. Yes, there it
was&mdash;she remembered seeing it, and Cary&#8217;s laughing reference
to it at the breakfast table that morning, coupled
with the statement that he meant to see it. The play was
one of the most noted dramatic successes of the season, its
star one famous for her beauty and sorcery, and not less
than infamous for the even artistically unjustifiable note
she never failed to strike, its lines and scenes the last word
in modern daring. A great play for a man and woman to
see together, with wine before and after! And Cary could
not safely so much as touch his lips to a glass of the most
innocent of the stimulants without danger to that appetite
of his which was as yet only scotched, not slain. If anything
happened <i>now</i> to wreck his plans&mdash;what confidence
in him, what hope of him, could be again revived?</p>

<p>After all, perhaps Jane was borrowing trouble. The pair
might have had only the walk they went for, Cary afterward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
taking the train for town alone. On the impulse&mdash;what
did it matter whom she offended if she saved her
brother from his great temptation?&mdash;she went to the telephone
and called up the Lockhart residence. Was Miss
Fitch in? The answer came back promptly: Miss Fitch
was not in. She had not left word when she would be in,
but it was likely that she had gone into town, as she had
spoken of the possibility.</p>

<p>Jane hung up the receiver with a heavy heart. Perhaps
her imagination was running away with her&mdash;she hoped
it was. But the conviction grew upon her that part, if
not all, of her supposition was likely to prove true. Fanny
Fitch might be quite above the kind of thing Jane was
imputing to her; it might be that Cary himself, aware of
the danger to his whole future of one false step now, would
be too thoroughly on his guard to take one smallest chance.
Hotel lobbies and caf&eacute;s were always the meeting places of
newspaper men; he might easily be recognized by some
man who knew that he was upon probation; Cary understood
this perfectly; he would take care to run no risk.
Would he?</p>

<p>Jane looked up the train schedule. Then she dressed
carefully, locked the shop, took the earliest train which
would get her to town, and tried to make plans on the way.
As to just what she meant to do she was not clear. If no
other way presented she felt that she must get hold of
Fanny herself and warn her of Cary&#8217;s susceptibilities and
the consequences of any weakening at this hour of his life.
And then what? Was there that in Fanny to be counted
on?</p>

<p>All the way she was wishing for Robert Black! Just
what he could do she had no idea; that he would somehow
find a way she was certain. But it was small use wishing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
The next best thing would be to come upon Red Pepper
Burns, and this seemed not impossible, because he was
daily to be found in this city of which his own town was
the suburb; he did most of his operating at one of its hospitals.
What Red might do in the emergency she could
hardly imagine, either&mdash;but she was equally sure that he
would cut across all obstacles to force Cary out of possible
danger.</p>

<p>To what hotel would Cary take Fanny? She could be
pretty sure of this&mdash;it was one at the moment highly
popular with the sociably inclined younger element of the
city, as well as with the floating class who pick out a certain
pronounced type of hostelry wherever they may go.
Rather more than moderately high prices, excellent food,
superlatively good music, a management astute beyond
the average&mdash;plus a general air of prosperity and good
fellowship&mdash;this makes the place for the gathering of
the clans who love what they call a good time, and who
have in their pockets&mdash;for the hour, at least&mdash;the money
to pay for it.</p>

<p>Jane left her train in haste, crossed the big waiting-room
with quick glances to right and left in search of a possible
encounter, and at the outer door ran full upon someone
she had not been looking for but at sight of whom a light
of relief leaped into her face. Mrs. Redfield Pepper Burns
stood close beside the door, evidently waiting for someone.
Instantly Jane&#8217;s decision was made. She did not know
Mrs. Burns nearly as well as she did the red-headed doctor,
but she knew her quite well enough to take counsel with
her, sure that she would understand and help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Burns,&#8221;&mdash;Jane spoke rapidly and low&mdash;&#8220;please
forgive me for bothering you with my affairs. I may be
borrowing trouble, but I am anxious about my brother.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
I think he is dining in town to-night at the Napoleon, and
may be going to a play. He is with Miss Fitch, I believe,
and I&#8217;m afraid she doesn&#8217;t understand that&mdash;just now&mdash;he
mustn&#8217;t take&mdash;any sort of stimulant. Doctor Burns
understands&mdash;perhaps you do, too&mdash;or will, from my telling
you this much. I wish&mdash;would it be too much?&mdash;to ask
you to stay and have dinner with me at the Napoleon, and
perhaps join Miss Fitch and Cary&mdash;or ask them to join us?
I can&#8217;t think just what else to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had always deeply admired Ellen Burns; now, quite
suddenly, she found herself loving her. One long look
from the beautiful black eyes, one firm pressure from the
friendly hand, the sound of the low, warm-toned voice in
her ear, and she knew that she had enlisted a true friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear&mdash;just let me think. I believe we can do
even better than that.&#8221; A minute of silence followed,
then Mrs. Burns went on: &#8220;My husband and Mr. Black
are staying in together, to meet a quite famous
man from abroad. They were to have dinner together
first at&mdash;&mdash;Wait&mdash;I&#8217;ll not stop to explain&mdash;Let me leave a
message here, and then we&#8217;ll take a cab and run back up
there. I&#8217;ve only just left them.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the cab, five minutes later, Mrs. Burns worked out her
quickly conceived idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find my husband and Mr. Black, go to dinner at
the Napoleon, and ask your brother and Miss Fitch to join
us. Once Red knows the situation he will find a way to
get Mr. Ray off with them to meet the famous one, and you
and I will take Miss Fitch to the play. What is on to-night?&#8221;
She drew her lovely brows together. &#8220;Not&mdash;oh,
not that very unpleasant Russian thing?&mdash;Yes? Oh, we&#8217;ll
find something else&mdash;or go to a charming violin recital I
had half intended to stay in for. Don&#8217;t be anxious, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Ray, we&#8217;ll work it out. And what we can&#8217;t think of Robert
Black will&mdash;he&#8217;s quite wonderfully resourceful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hours afterward, when, well towards morning, Jane
closed her eyes and tried to sleep, her mind refused to give
her anything to look at but a series of pictures, like scenes
in a well-staged play. Certain ones stood out, and the
earliest of these showed Mrs. Burns crossing a quiet reception
room to lay one hand on her husband&#8217;s arm, while her
eyes met frankly first his questioning gaze and then that
of Robert Black. Nothing could have been simpler than
her reasonable request of them. Might they change their
plans a bit, now that she had found Miss Ray, and all go
over to the Napoleon to dinner, to find Miss Fitch and Mr.
Ray? The hazel eyes of Red Pepper Burns had looked
deeply into his wife&#8217;s at this&mdash;he saw plainly that she was
definitely planning, with a reason. He was well used to
trusting her&mdash;he trusted her now. He nodded. &#8220;Of
course, dear,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Robert Black came to Jane. &#8220;I think I understand,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all stand by.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the street together&mdash;Red went to interview
the head waiter. Within five minutes the four were
being led to a table at the very back of the room, close beside
one of those small recesses, holding each a table for
two, which are among the Napoleon&#8217;s most popular assets.
And then Mrs. Burns, looking across into the recess, had
nodded and smiled, and spoken to her husband, and he
had promptly gone across, and invited the pair there to
come over and be his guests.</p>

<p>Cary had turned violently red, and had begun to say
stiffly and very definitely that his order had gone in,
and that it would be as well not to change, thank you,
when Robert Black came also into the recess, bowing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
his most dignified manner to Fanny Fitch. Somehow
Jane Ray had not known until that moment quite how
much dignity he could assume. &#8220;Ray,&#8221; he had said, in the
other&#8217;s ear, &#8220;I imagine you haven&#8217;t heard that Richard
Temple is here to-night&mdash;on his way back. Couldn&#8217;t you
cut everything else and go with me to hear him? There
won&#8217;t be such a chance again before we get across. I&#8217;m
sure Miss Fitch would excuse you. It&#8217;s a smoker, arranged
in a hurry. Nobody knew he was coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, that made all the difference. Call it luck, call it
what you will, that the great war-correspondent, the greatest
of them all up to that time, a man whom Cary Ray
would almost have given his right arm to meet, was passing
through the town that night. It had been another
man, more famous in a different line, an Englishman from
a great university, turned soldier, whom Black and Red
had stayed in town to meet. But the moment Black had
discovered Jane&#8217;s anxiety and its cause he had leaped at
this solution. The correspondent&#8217;s coming was an accident
owing to a train detention&mdash;he had arrived unheralded, and
the two men had but just got wind of it. They had been
saying, as Mrs. Burns and Jane came to the hotel, that
it was hard to have to choose between two such rich events,
and that they must look in on the smoker when the
Englishman had been heard. But now&mdash;Black had all at
once but one purpose in the world&mdash;to carry off Cary Ray
to that smoker, and to stay beside him till he was at home
again. That Cary would drink no drop while he, Robert,
was beside him, was a thing that could be definitely
counted on.</p>

<p>It is possible that no point of view, in relation to the
remainder of the evening, could be better worth study than
that of Fanny Fitch. Sitting on the foot of Nan Lockhart&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
bed at two o&#8217;clock that morning, she gave a dramatic
account of what had happened. Nan, sleepy enough at
first, and indignant with Fanny for waking her, found
herself wide awake in no time.</p>

<p>&#8220;The perfectly calm and charming way in which Mrs.
Burns simply switched everything to suit Jane shows
plainly what an intriguer that girl is&mdash;precisely as I told
you. Oh, yes&mdash;Doctor Burns asked us over, and Robert
Black fixed Cary for the war-correspondent affair, and
Jane sat there looking as if butter wouldn&#8217;t melt in her
mouth. Both she and Mrs. Burns seemed merely lovely,
innocent creatures intent on distributing good to everybody!
But those men never would have thought of taking
Cary away from me if they hadn&#8217;t been put up to it; men
never conceive that sort of thing by themselves. That
dinner&mdash;oh, how I hated it! <i>Will</i> you tell me why Cary
Ray had to be pried loose from me, as if I were some kind
of vampire of the movie variety&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But really, Fanny, Richard Temple <i>is</i> the one man
in the world Cary Ray ought not to miss hearing and meeting
just now. It would mean such a lot to him. And if
he was only there that one evening&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll admit that! But to hear Richard Temple
Cary Ray didn&#8217;t have to be moved over to the Burns table
and put in a high chair and have a bib tied round his neck!
He was furious himself when the change was proposed;
then of course he went delirious at hearing that the Temple
man was in town, and forgot his fury. He had to cancel
part of his order&mdash;worse luck; Mrs. Burns is the sort who
wouldn&#8217;t stand for iced tea if it was served in a champagne
glass!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny! You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;Why, surely you&#8217;ve been
told about Cary Ray. You wouldn&#8217;t let him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;Good gracious, can&#8217;t the man stand alone by this time?
He&#8217;s going overseas&mdash;has he got to have a nurse along?
What&#8217;s having one little glass at a dinner with a girl like
me compared with the things men order when they&#8217;re alone
together? He&#8217;d better stay home if he isn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;just now, when he&#8217;s on trial, and he might
so easily be held back! And besides, Fanny&mdash;you&#8217;re not&mdash;you
ought not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t preach! Haven&#8217;t I been a very model of
propriety? And am I not going to keep right on being
one, as long as there&#8217;s the least chance of&mdash;getting what I
want? You needn&#8217;t grudge me one little jolly evening
with a boy like Cary Ray, who comes nearer understanding
the sort of fire and flame I&#8217;m made of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan Lockhart lay back upon her pillow. &#8220;Fanny,&#8221;
she said despairingly, &#8220;the best thing you can do is to go to
bed. When you begin to talk about your temperament
you make me want to give you a cold plunge and a rub-down,
and tie an ice-cap on your head. You&#8217;ve probably
been saved from helping Cary Ray make a fool of himself
at a time when he can&#8217;t afford to be a fool, and you&#8217;d
better be thankful. How you can imagine that a thing
like that would help you to find a place in Robert Black&#8217;s
good graces&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s gentle Jane who&#8217;s ace-high with him just now,
of course!&#8221; Fanny pulled the hairpins out of her hair with
vicious twitches, letting the whole gleaming fair mass
fall upon the white silk of the luxurious little garment in
which she had enveloped herself before coming to Nan&#8217;s
room. &#8220;He&#8217;s the sort who was born to rescue the fallen,
and serve the anxious and troubled. He acted like a
regular knight to Jane&mdash;not that he said much to her, but
one could see. He was very nice to me&mdash;too nice. I&#8217;d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
much prefer the Jane-brand of his chivalry&mdash;sort of an
I&#8217;ll-stand-in-front-of-you-and-take-the-blows effect. And
when he went off with Cary and Doctor Burns, and I was
left with those two women creatures&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I can&#8217;t let you keep speaking of Mrs. Burns
that way. She&#8217;s one of the finest, sweetest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a peach!&#8221; said Fanny, unexpectedly. &#8220;I admit
I&#8217;ve nothing against Mrs. Burns except that she took me
to a dismal violin recital when I&#8217;d awfully wanted to see a
perfectly ripping play Cary had tickets for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny nodded. &#8220;Of course&mdash;why not, Miss Prudy?
I didn&#8217;t mind that so much, though. The thing I minded
was Jane Ray&#8217;s sleekness. She makes me think of one
of those silky black cats with yellow eyes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But here Nan Lockhart sat up in bed, fire in her own
steel-gray eyes. &#8220;Fanny Fitch, that&#8217;s enough!&#8221; she said,
with low distinctness. &#8220;Jane Ray is my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought <i>I</i> was! This is so sudden!&#8221; And quite
unexpectedly, even to herself, Fanny Fitch began to cry,
with long, sobbing breaths. Nan slipped out of bed,
pulled on a loose gown hanging over its foot, and laid hold
of Fanny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; she commanded, firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to put
you to bed and give Nature a chance to restore those absurd
nerves of yours. You don&#8217;t want Cary Ray, you
can&#8217;t have Robert Black, and you might just as well give
in and take that perfectly good lover of yours who has been
faithful to you all these years. He adores you enough to
put up with the very worst of you, and he ought to be
rewarded with the best of you. You know absolutely
that you&#8217;d be the most miserable girl in the world married
to a man of Mr. Black&#8217;s type&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>Fanny drew a deep sigh, her head on Nan&#8217;s long-suffering
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll not be my fault if I don&#8217;t have a try at that sort of
misery,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll do it yet, see if I don&#8217;t!
I know a way!&mdash;Oh, yes! I know a way! Wait and see!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan Lockhart saw her finally composed for sleep, her
fair head looking like a captivating cameo against her
pillow, her white arms meekly crossed upon her breast.
Fanny looked up at her friend, her face once more serene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I look good enough now for just anybody?&#8221; she
murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like a young stained-glass angel,&#8221; Nan replied,
grimly. &#8220;But&mdash;since you were so unjust as to compare
Jane Ray to a silky <i>black</i> cat I&#8217;ll tell you that just
now you make me think of&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know&mdash;a sleepy white one&mdash;with a saucer of cream
near by. Good-night&mdash;saint! I don&#8217;t deserve you, but&mdash;I
love you just the same. And I dare you to tell me you
don&#8217;t love me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take no dares of yours to-night. Go to sleep&mdash;and
please let me, even if you don&#8217;t.&#8221; And Nan went away
and closed the door.</p>

<p>Back in her own room, when she was once more lying
alone in the dark, Nan said to herself, with a sigh deeper
than any Fanny Fitch had ever drawn in all her gay young
life: &#8220;What a queer thing it is to be able to wear one&#8217;s
heart on one&#8217;s sleeve like that&mdash;and not even mind much
when the daws peck at it!&#8221;</p>

<small>A GREAT GASH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;CONFOUND you&mdash;pay some attention to me, will
you? Do you <i>get</i> what I&#8217;m saying? Everything&#8217;s
in train. I&#8217;ve only to take my physical examination&mdash;papers
came this morning, by the way&mdash;and get my
passports, and I&#8217;m off. For the love of heaven, what&#8217;s
the matter with you, Max Buller? Sitting there looking
like a mollusc&mdash;like a barnacle glued to a rock&mdash;and me
having transports all over the place! Don&#8217;t you know a
magnificently happy man when you see one&mdash;and can&#8217;t
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Red&#8217;s manner suddenly changed, as Dr. Maxwell Buller
looked up at him with an expression of mingled pain and
protest. Red&#8217;s voice softened, his smiling lips grew sober.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, Max, old man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re
in trouble, and I&#8217;m a blind ass&mdash;as usual. What&#8217;s the
matter? The Throckmorton case gone wrong, after all?
Or worse things befallen? Come&mdash;out with it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buller got up. He was Burns&#8217; best friend in the profession&mdash;the
two had stood together since the earliest days
of medical school and hospital training. Buller was not
a brilliant member of the healing fraternity, but a steady-going,
conscientious, doggedly energetic practitioner on
whose sturdy friendship through all the thick and thin of
the regular grind Burns was accustomed to rely. Never a
crisis in the professional affairs of either man but he called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
with confidence upon the bed-rock reliability of the other
to see him through.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, Red, bursting with the
latest developments in the arrangements he was pushing
through in order to be able to get away and join Dr. John
Leaver at an American hospital in France, had rushed into
Buller&#8217;s office considerably before office hours. He had
shouted his plans into the other&#8217;s ears&mdash;so to speak&mdash;though
technically he had not much raised his voice above
its customary low professional pitch. The whole effect
of him, none the less, had been that of a boy roaring at a
comrade across several fences that he had been given a
holiday and was off for glorious sport. And here was his
trusty comrade-in-arms glowering gloomily back at him
and as good as saying that he grudged him his luck and
hoped he&#8217;d have the worst possible time of it. That wasn&#8217;t
a bit like Buller&mdash;good old Buller, who hadn&#8217;t a selfish
hair on his head, and knew no such thing as professional
jealousy where R. P. Burns was concerned. What in the
name of time was the matter with him?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d no idea,&#8221; said Buller, at last, and hesitating
strangely, &#8220;the thing had gone so far. I knew you thought
of going, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what? Haven&#8217;t I been talking going for the last
year and a half? And didn&#8217;t I call you up the other day
when I got Jack Leaver&#8217;s cable and tell you I meant to
put it through post-haste? Didn&#8217;t I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve told me all about it. You&#8217;ll remember
that I&#8217;ve said a good deal about the need for you right
here, and my hope that you&#8217;d delay going a while yet.
I think I said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what <i>you</i> said,&#8221; Red broke in impatiently,
interrupting Buller&#8217;s slower speech in a way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
which the other was well used. &#8220;I was much too busy
talking myself to notice what any idiot might be saying
on lines like those. Good Lord! man, you <i>knew</i> I&#8217;d go the
minute I got the chance. Why, I&#8217;m needed over there
about sixteen thousand times more than I am here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Buller shook his head, his unhappy eyes on the worn rug
of his office floor. The shake of that head inflamed Red
into wild speech, his fist clenched and brought down on
Buller&#8217;s desk till bottles jumped and papers flew off into
space. Then, suddenly, he brought himself up short.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve blown off. Now&mdash;explain
yourself, if you can&mdash;which I doubt. But I can at
least give you the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buller cleared his throat. He ran his hand through
the rapidly graying locks above his anxious brow, sat down
at his desk again&mdash;as though it might be a little easier to
say what he had to say in this customary seat of the
judge delivering sentence&mdash;and looked unwillingly up at
his friend. Red had moved up and closed in on him as
he sat down, towering over the desk like a defiant prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get it over,&#8221; he commanded briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to, Red, but&mdash;it&#8217;s hard to know how to begin....
You&mdash;suppose you let me go over you, will
you?&mdash;as a sort of preliminary to the examination the
Government surgeons will give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for? Do you think I can&#8217;t pass? Is <i>that</i> what&#8217;s
bothering you?&#8221; A relieved laugh came with the words.
&#8220;Me?&#8221; He smote his broad chest with all the confidence
in the world&mdash;and Buller winced at the gesture. &#8220;Why,
I&#8217;m strong as an ox.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buller opened a drawer and took out a stethoscope.
&#8220;Well&mdash;you won&#8217;t mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he said, apologetically, and
came around the desk as a man might who had to put a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
pistol to the head of a beloved dog, and was dreading the
sound of the shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. But it&#8217;s about the foolest thing I ever knew
you to put up to me.&#8221; Red pulled off his coat, stripped
rapidly to the waist, and presented himself for the inquisition.</p>

<p>Two minutes of absolute silence succeeded during which
Buller swallowed twice as if he were trying to get rid of his
own palate. Then he stood up with his hand on Red&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;awfully sorry, lad,&#8221; he said&mdash;and looked it, in a
fashion the other could not doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;remember that little trouble you had two
years ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The&mdash;infection?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s left its mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you <i>mean</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right for good solid hard work&mdash;here. But
you aren&#8217;t quite in condition to meet the&mdash;requirements
of the Service. You&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t get by, Red.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buller turned away, his chunky, square-fingered hand
slightly unsteady as he put away the little tell-tale apparatus
which had registered the hardest fact with which he
had ever had to confront a patient&mdash;and a friend. There
was a full minute&#8217;s silence behind him, while he deliberately
kept his back turned, unwilling to witness the first coming
to grips with the totally unsuspected revelation. Then:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say my heart isn&#8217;t all right?&#8221; came in
a queer, indignant tone which Buller knew meant only
one thing: that Red minded nothing at all about his
physical condition except as it was bound to affect the
course upon which he had set out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;Not&mdash;exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quit treating me like a scared patient. I know
you <i>think</i> you heard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did hear it, Red. There&#8217;s no possible doubt. It&#8217;s
unquestionably the result of the infection of two years
ago. We all knew it then. I knew I&#8217;d find it now.
That&#8217;s why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve been advising me not to go.
My place was here&mdash;<i>knitting</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Buller was silent. His broad, kind face worked a little
as the big figure crossed the room to the window. He
could look up now&mdash;Red&#8217;s back was toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the amount of work I stand up under, every
earthly day and night, show that in spite of your blamed
old dissection I could do a good job over there before I
cash in&mdash;which, of course, may be indefinitely postponed?
Nobody knows better than you that a fellow can go on
working like a fiend for years with the rottenest sort of
heart, and never even suspect himself that there&#8217;s a thing
wrong&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221; Buller&#8217;s voice was gentle as a woman&#8217;s.
&#8220;But&mdash;first you&#8217;ve got to pass the stiffest sort of Government
tests, Red&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And I can&#8217;t, eh?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was done&mdash;Max Buller&#8217;s job. He didn&#8217;t have to
answer that last question&mdash;which was no question, as he
well knew. There was finality in Red&#8217;s own voice; he had
accepted the fact. He knew too well the uselessness of
doubting Buller&#8217;s judgment&mdash;the other man was too well
qualified professionally for that. Red knew, also, as well
as if he had been told in plain language, precisely what his
own condition must be. Out of the race he was&mdash;that
was all there was to it. Still fit to carry heavy burdens,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
capable of sustaining the old routine under the old terms,
but unfit to take his place among the new runners on the
new track, where the prize was to be greater than any
he had ever won. And his splendid body, at that very
minute, seemingly as perfect as it had ever been; every
function, as far as he himself could be aware, in the smoothest
running order! He could not even be more than usually
conscious of the beat of his own heart, so apparently
undisturbed it was by this intolerable news; while his
spirit, his unquenched spirit, was giving him the hardest
tussle of his life.</p>

<p>Buller was wrong&mdash;he <i>must</i> be wrong! He was &#8220;hearing
things&#8221; that didn&#8217;t exist. Red wheeled about, the inconsistent
accusation on his lips. It died at sight of his
friend. Buller was slouched down in his swivel-chair,
his chin on his breast, his head propped on his hand.
Quite clearly Buller was taking this thing as hard&mdash;vicariously&mdash;as
Red himself&mdash;as Buller usually took
things that affected Red adversely. Oh, yes&mdash;the old
boy knew&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t be fooled on a diagnosis like that.
Red turned back to the window. It was all over&mdash;there
was no possible appeal....</p>

<p>He went away almost immediately, and quite silently.
There had been no torrent of speech since the blow actually
went home. The red-headed surgeon with Celtic blood
in his veins could be quiet enough when there was no use
saying anything, as there certainly wasn&#8217;t now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days later Robert Black, hurrying down the street,
traveling bag in hand, passed the office of Redfield Pepper
Burns just as the doctor&#8217;s car drew up at the curb. Black
turned, halted, and came up to the car. Red was sitting
still in it, waiting for him, the unstopped motor throbbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
quietly. Black hadn&#8217;t seen him for several days, but the
last he knew Red had been deep in his preparation for an
early departure. It was on Black&#8217;s lips to say, &#8220;How&#8217;s
everything coming on?&#8221;&mdash;knowing that no other subject
had any interest for Red compared with that. But Red
spoke first.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to know sooner or later,&#8221; he said, in his
gruffest tone, &#8220;so you might as well know now. I&#8217;m not
going over. That&#8217;s all. Can&#8217;t stop to talk about it.&#8221;
And he set hand to gear-shift, and with a nod was off again,
leaving Black standing looking after him, feeling as if
something had hit him between the eyes.</p>

<p>As he walked on, after a moment, his mind was busy
with the impressions it had received in that brief encounter.
Red&#8217;s face had been set and stern; it was often
that when he was worn with work over more than usually
hard cases. His eyes had looked straight at Black with
his customary unevasive gaze, but&mdash;there had been something
strange in that look. He was unhappy&mdash;desperately
unhappy, there could be no doubt about that. What
could have happened so suddenly to put a spoke in the
rapidly turning wheels of his plans? Black fell to puzzling
over it, himself growing every moment more disturbed.
He cared tremendously what happened to Red; he found
himself caring more and more with each succeeding
thought about it.</p>

<p>He was on his way to the station, to take a train for a
distant city, where was to be held a reunion of his seminary
class in the old halls of their training. He had been looking
forward to it for weeks, in expectation of meeting certain
classmates whom he had not seen for six years, and
some of whom he might never meet again. He had been
exchanging letter after letter with them about it, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
anticipating the event with the ardour with which most
men look forward to such reunions at that period in life.
There was nothing to do but go, of course; though by now
he was longing intensely to follow up Red, by some means,
and find out what was the matter. He hadn&#8217;t liked the
look in those hazel eyes, usually so full of spirit and purpose;
the more he thought about it the surer he grew that
Red was at some crisis in his life, and that he needed something
he hadn&#8217;t got to help him face it. Of course he must
be horribly disappointed not to be going across, oh, desperately
disappointed! But there was more than that
in the situation to make him look like that, Black was
sure of it.</p>

<p>His feet continued to move toward the station, his eyes
lifting to the clock upon its tower, which warned him that
he must lose no time. He had his ticket and a sleeper
reservation&mdash;it was fifteen hours&#8217; journey back to the
old ivy-covered halls which had grown dearer in his memory
with each succeeding year of his absence. He was thinking
that he couldn&#8217;t disappoint Evans, his best friend, or
Desboro, his old college chum who was going to China
on the next ship that sailed; such appointments were
sacred&mdash;the men would never quite forgive him if he threw
them over. But this he could do: he could go on for
the dinner which was to take place the following evening,
and then catch a late train back, cutting the rest
of the program, and reaching home again after only forty-eight
hours&#8217; interval; he had expected to be absent at
least five days. No, he couldn&#8217;t, either. Desboro was
on for an address, that second evening, for which he
had expressed particular hope that Black would remain.
Desboro was a sensitive chap and he was going to China.
Well&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>His train had been called; those determined feet of his
took him toward it, though his mind was now slowing them
perceptibly. And then, suddenly, his will took charge
of the matter&mdash;his will, and his love. He loved Red
Pepper Burns&mdash;he knew it now, if he had not fully known
it before; loved him even better than he did Desboro, or
Evans, or any of the rest of them for whom he had cared
so much in the old days. And Red was in trouble. Could
he leave him to go on to hear Desboro&#8217;s speech, or wring
Evans&#8217; hand, or even to hear a certain one of his adored
old professors say: &#8220;I&#8217;m especially glad to see you, Black&mdash;I
want to hear all about you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; a probability he
had been happily visualizing as worth the trip, though he
should get nothing more out of it.</p>

<p>He turned about face with determination, his decision
made. What was a class reunion, with all its pleasures&mdash;and
its disappointments, too&mdash;compared with standing
by a friend who needed him? The consciousness that Red
was quite as likely to repel as to welcome him&mdash;more
likely, at that&mdash;lent no hesitation to his steps. He went
back to the ticket windows, succeeded in getting his money
returned, and retraced his steps to the manse even more
rapidly than he had come away from it. It was only
as he let himself in at the door that he remembered that
his little vacation was Mrs. Hodder&#8217;s as well, and that at
his insistence she had left early that morning. He grinned
rather ruefully at this thought; so it was to be burned
toast and tinned beans again, instead of banquet food!
Well, when a fellow was making sacrifices for a friend, let
him make them and not permit the thought of a little lost
food to make him hesitate. Banquets&mdash;and beans&mdash;interesting
alliteration! And now&mdash;to find out about Red
without loss of time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>Ten minutes later he was in Red&#8217;s home, standing, hat in
hand, before Mrs. Burns, who had come to him without delay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw your husband just a minute this morning, and he
told me it was all off with his going to France. That&#8217;s
all he said&mdash;except that he had no time to talk about it.
Of course I understood that he didn&#8217;t want <i>me</i> to talk about
it. But something in his looks made me a little anxious.
I thought you wouldn&#8217;t mind my coming to you. If you
don&#8217;t want to tell me anything more, Mrs. Burns, that&#8217;s
all right. But I wanted you to know that if anything has
happened to make him&mdash;or you&mdash;unhappy, I care very
much. And I wish I could help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen Burns looked up into his face, and saw there all
that one could wish to see in a friend&#8217;s face when one is in
trouble. She answered as frankly as he had spoken, and
he couldn&#8217;t help seeing that his coming was a relief to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you, Mr. Black,&#8221; she said. She
remained standing; Black thought it might be because she
was too ill at ease in mind to think of sitting down. &#8220;I
am anxious about Red, too, because he doesn&#8217;t seem at all
himself, since this happened. Two days ago his good friend
Doctor Buller told him there was no chance of his passing
the physical tests necessary for getting across, on account
of trouble with his heart&mdash;which he hadn&#8217;t even
suspected. He was very ill with blood poisoning two
years ago. The disappointment has been even greater
than I could have imagined it would be; he has never set
his heart on anything as he has on this chance to be of
service in France. Of course I am disappointed, too&mdash;I
meant to follow him soon, when we could arrange it.
And&mdash;it goes without saying&mdash;that the reason which
keeps him is a good deal of a blow to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;of course.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>She was speaking very quietly, and with entire control
of voice and manner, and the sympathetic understanding
in his tone did not undermine her, because there was no
weakness in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;we have accepted it; there&#8217;s nothing else to do.
Doctor Buller says it doesn&#8217;t mean that Red can&#8217;t go on
working as hard as ever, for a long time&mdash;here. But that
doesn&#8217;t help him any, just yet. He has been in&mdash;a mood&mdash;so
dark ever since he knew, that even I can&#8217;t seem to
lighten it. And just before you came I found&mdash;this.
It&mdash;does make me anxious, Mr. Black, because I don&#8217;t
quite know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her hand into a fold of her dress and brought
out a leaf from the daily memorandum pad with a large
sized date at the top, which was accustomed to lie on Red&#8217;s
desk. He was in the habit of leaving upon it, each time he
went out, a list of calls, or a statement regarding his whereabouts,
that his office nurse or his wife might have no difficulty
in finding him in case of need. In the present instance
the page was well covered with the morning and
afternoon lists of his regular rounds, including an early
morning operation at the hospital. But the latest entry
was of a different character. At the very bottom of the
sheet, in the only space left, was scrawled the usual preliminary
phrase, followed by a long and heavy dash, so
that the effect of the whole was inevitably suggestive of a
reckless mood: &#8220;Gone to &mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Black studied this for some seconds before he lifted his
eyes. &#8220;It may mean nothing at all,&#8221; he said, as quietly
as Mrs. Burns had spoken, &#8220;except the reflection of his
unhappiness. I can&#8217;t think it could mean anything else.
Just the same&#8221;&mdash;and now he looked at the lovely face
before him, to see in it that he might offer to do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
at all which could mean help for Red&mdash;&#8220;I think I&#8217;d like
to find him for you&mdash;and I will. I&#8217;m sure I can, even
though you don&#8217;t know where he has gone. Can you
guess at all where it might be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had the car,&#8221; she said, considering, &#8220;and he&#8217;s very
apt, when things have gone wrong, to get off out of doors
somewhere&mdash;alone&mdash;though he&#8217;s quite as likely to work
off his trouble by driving at a furious pace over miles and
miles of road. I&#8217;ve known him to jump out of the car and
dash off into the woods, in some place I&#8217;d never seen
before, and come back all out of breath and laughing, and
say he&#8217;d left it all behind. I think, perhaps, that&#8217;s what
he&#8217;s doing now. I hope he&#8217;ll come back laughing this time,
though I&mdash;I can&#8217;t help wishing he&#8217;d taken me with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish he had.&#8221; Black thought he had never seen a
woman take a thing like this with so much sense and courage.
How could Red have left her behind, he wondered,
just now, when she could do so much for him? Or&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
she? Could any woman, no matter how finely
understanding, do for him quite what another man could&mdash;a
man who would know better than any woman just what
it must mean to have the foundations suddenly knocked
out from under him like that? &#8220;But,&#8221; he went on quickly,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it will be difficult to find him because&mdash;there&#8217;s
a way. And I&#8217;m going now, to try it. Don&#8217;t be
worried. I have a strong feeling that your husband is
coming out of this a bigger man even than when it hit
him&mdash;he&#8217;s that sort of man.&#8221; He was silent an instant, and
then went on: &#8220;And he won&#8217;t do anything God doesn&#8217;t
mean him to do&mdash;because he isn&#8217;t <i>that</i> sort of man. He&#8217;s
not afraid of death&mdash;but he isn&#8217;t afraid of life, either.
Good-bye&mdash;it&#8217;s going to be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They smiled at each other, heartened, both, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
thought of action. Black got away at once. It was, by
now, well after six o&#8217;clock. He had had no dinner, but it
didn&#8217;t occur to him to look out for food before he started
on the long walk he meant to take. For, somehow, he was
suddenly quite sure he knew where to go....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had guessed right. Was it a guess? As he had
walked at his best speed out of the town and over the highway
toward the road upon which Red had taken him that
winter night, months ago, he had been saying over and
over, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me be wrong, Lord&mdash;you know I&#8217;ve <i>got</i>
to find him!&#8221; He was remembering something Red had
said when he first led him up the trail and out upon the
rocky little plateau: &#8220;This is a place I&#8217;ve never brought
anybody to&mdash;not even my wife, as it happens&mdash;and probably
wouldn&#8217;t be bringing you if we had time to go farther.
I come here sometimes&mdash;to thrash things out, or get rid
of my ugly temper. The place is littered with my chips.&#8221;</p>

<p>He recalled answering, &#8220;All right, Doctor. I won&#8217;t be
looking for the chips.&#8221; But he had thoroughly appreciated
being brought to the spot at all, recognizing it for one of
those intimate places in a man&#8217;s experience which he keeps
very much to himself. Where, now, would Red be so
likely to go if he had something still to &#8220;thrash out,&#8221;
after the two days of storm following the shock of Doctor
Buller&#8217;s revelation?</p>

<p>At the bottom of the hill, well-hidden in a thicket of
trees, Black came upon the car&mdash;and suddenly slowed his
pace. He was close upon Red, then, and about to thrust
himself in where he was pretty sure not to be wanted&mdash;at
first. He meant to make himself wanted, if he knew how.
Did he know how? Ah, that was where he must have help.
It was going to take more than human wisdom, thus to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
try to deal with the sore heart, the baffled spirit, of the
man who couldn&#8217;t have his own way at what doubtless
seemed to him the greatest moment of his life. Black
stopped short, close to a great oak, and put up his arm
against it, and hid his face in his arm, and asked God
mightily that in this hour He would use His servant&#8217;s
personality as He would use a tool in His workshop, and
show him how to come as close and touch as gently&mdash;and
withal as healingly&mdash;as it might be possible for human
personality to do when backed and reinforced by the
Divine. A pretty big request? Yes, but the need was
big. And Black didn&#8217;t put it in any such exalted phrasing&mdash;remember
that. What he said was just this: &#8220;Please
let me help. I <i>must</i> help, for he needs me&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
know how. But You do&mdash;and You can show me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, after a minute, he went on, springing up the trail,
which was plain enough now, even in the fading daylight,
to be easily followed. As he reached the top he came in
sight of Red through the trees, and stopped short, not so
much to regain his breath as because the sight of the man
he had come to find made his heart turn over in sympathy,
and for that instant he couldn&#8217;t go on.</p>

<p>Yet Red was in no dramatic attitude of despair. To
the casual eye he would have looked as normal as man
could look. He sat upon a log&mdash;one of two, facing each
other, with a pile of blackened sticks and ashes between,
reminiscent of past campfires. There had been no fire
there recently&mdash;no spark lingered to tell the tale of warmth
and light and comradeship that may be found in a fire.
And what Red was doing was merely whittling a stick.
Surely no tragedy was here, or fear of one.... The
thing that told the tale, though, unmistakably, to Black&#8217;s
sharpened eyes, was this: that the ground was littered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
deep, all about Red&#8217;s feet, with the fresh whittlings of
many sticks. &#8220;Chips,&#8221; indeed! Chips out of his very
life, Black knew they were; hewed away ruthlessly, with
no regard as to what was left behind in the cutting, or what
was made thereof.</p>

<p>He could not stand and look on, unobserved, of course.
So he came on, striding ahead; and when Red at last looked
up it was to see Black advancing confidently, as a friend
comes to join a friend. Red stared across the space; his
eyes looked dazed, and a little bloodshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come,&#8221; said Black, simply, &#8220;because, Red, I
thought you needed me. Maybe you don&#8217;t want me, but
I think you need me, and I&#8217;m hoping you won&#8217;t send me
away. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll go if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red&#8217;s odd, almost unseeing gaze returned to the stick
in his hand. He cut away two or three more big chunks
from it, leaving it an unsightly remnant; then flung it
away, to join the other jagged remnants upon the
ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, in a hoarse voice quite unlike his own,
&#8220;I guess maybe I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black&#8217;s heart leaped. He had not expected a reception
like this. To be kicked out&mdash;metaphorically&mdash;or to be
ungraciously permitted to remain&mdash;that was the best he
could have hoped for. He sat down upon the other
log, took off his hat and ran his hand through the locks
on his moist brow; he was both warm and tired, but he
was not in the least conscious of either fact. All he knew
or cared for was that he had found his man&mdash;and had his
chance at last! And now that he had it&mdash;the chance he
had so long wanted, to make this man he loved his friend
forever&mdash;he was not thinking of that part of his wish at
all. He had got beyond that; all he wanted now was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
see him through his trouble, though it might make him
less his friend than ever.</p>

<p>The two sat in silence for a minute. Then Red spoke.
With an odd twist of the mouth he pointed to an axe
lying at the foot of a tree not far away. Above it, in
the trunk, showed a great fresh gash, the beginning of a
skilled woodsman&#8217;s work upon a tree which he means to
fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I began to chop down that tree,&#8221; he said, in the same
queer, hoarse voice. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always done&mdash;when
the pressure got too high. Then&mdash;I remembered.
If I chopped it down, I might&mdash;end things. There&#8217;s no
telling. Buller says my machinery&#8217;s got past the chopping
point&mdash;it&#8217;s time to take to whittling. So&mdash;I&#8217;m whittling&mdash;as
you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Black. He spoke cheerfully&mdash;there was
no pity in his voice. In his eyes&mdash;but Red was not looking
at those.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why,&#8221; went on Red, after a minute, &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going to France. They don&#8217;t need whittlers over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you&#8217;re a whittler?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look much like one&mdash;to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that to me!&#8221; challenged Red, with a touch
of the old fire. &#8220;There&#8217;s no cure for my hurt in the
thought that I can keep on working&mdash;over here&mdash;until
the machinery breaks down entirely&mdash;which may not be
for a good while yet. I want what I want&mdash;and I can&#8217;t
have it. What I can have&#8217;s no good compared with
that. It may look good to you&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t to me. That&#8217;s
all there is of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like a whittler to me,&#8221; Black repeated,
sturdily. &#8220;You look like a tree chopper. I can&#8217;t&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
won&#8217;t&mdash;think of you any other way.... I wish you&#8217;d
put up that knife!&#8221;</p>

<p>Red stared at him. &#8220;Make you nervous?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It makes <i>you</i> nervous. Put it up. Play with the
axe, if you like; that&#8217;s more in character.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two looked each other in the eye for a minute.
The clear gaze of Black met the bloodshot one of Red.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&mdash;I&#8217;ll get it for you,&#8221; offered Black, and got up
and went over and picked up the axe, its blade shining, its
edge keen as one of Red&#8217;s instruments. Black ran his
fingers cautiously along it. &#8220;I suppose no surgeon ever
owned a dull axe,&#8221; he commented, as he brought it to
Red. &#8220;This would cut a hair, I think. Take it&mdash;and
put up the knife to please me, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to oblige.&#8221; Grimly Red accepted the axe,
snapped the knife shut and dropped it into his pocket.
&#8220;Anything else? Going to preach to me now with the axe
for a text?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re ready. But the axe won&#8217;t
do for a text&mdash;nor even for an illustration. I&#8217;ve got that
here.&#8221; He put his hand to his pocket and drew out a
little, worn, leather-bound Book, over which he looked
with a keen, fearless gaze at Red. &#8220;See here,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I could try a lot of applied psychology leading up
to this little Book&mdash;and you&#8217;d recognize, all the way, that
that was what I was doing. What&#8217;s the use? When you
go to see a patient, and know by the look of him and the
few things he tells you what&#8217;s the matter, you don&#8217;t lead
up by degrees to giving him the medicine he needs, do
you? Not you! You write your prescription on the
spot, and say &#8216;Take this.&#8217; And he takes it and gets
well.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;Or dies&mdash;if I&#8217;m out of luck. It isn&#8217;t the medicine that
decides it, either way. It&#8217;s his own power of resistance.
So your simile&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black nodded. This sounded to him somewhat more
like the old Red. &#8220;Yours is, then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s your
power of resistance I&#8217;m calling on. You used it just now&mdash;when
you stopped chopping at that tree. Do you think
I don&#8217;t know&mdash;you wanted to keep on, and take the possible
consequences&mdash;which you almost hoped&mdash;or thought
you hoped&mdash;would be the probable ones?&#8221;</p>

<p>And now Red&#8217;s startled eyes met his. &#8220;My God!&#8221; he
ejaculated, and got to his feet quickly, dropping the axe.
He strode away among the trees for a minute, then came
slowly back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think, Bob Black,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;you dare
tackle a case like mine? I see you know what I&#8217;m up
against. Do you imagine there&#8217;s anything in that Book
there that&mdash;fits my case?&#8221; And Black saw that his
eyes looked hungrily at the little Book&mdash;as men&#8217;s eyes
have looked since it was given shape. When there is
nowhere else to go for wisdom, even the most unwonted
hands open the Book&mdash;and find there what they honestly
seek.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know there is.&#8221; Black opened the Book&mdash;it fell open
easily, as one much used. He looked along its pages, as
one familiar with every line. It took but a moment to
find the words he sought. In a clear, quiet voice he read
the great, brave words of Paul the apostle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one
receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</p>

<p>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in
all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but
we an incorruptible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one
that beateth the air:</p>

<p>But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, lest
that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself
should be a castaway.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>A long silence followed the reading of these words.
Suddenly it had seemed to Robert Black that nothing he
could say could possibly add to the splendid challenge of
them to a flagging human spirit. Almost immediately
upon reading the last word he had walked away&mdash;he had
risen to read them, as if such words could be said only by a
man upon his feet. He was gone for perhaps ten minutes,
and all the while his heart was back there by the ashes of
the dead campfire with Red&mdash;fighting alone, as a man
must fight, no matter how his friend would help him.
Somehow Black was sure that he <i>was</i> fighting&mdash;it was
not in Red&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t be&mdash;to lay down his arms.
Or, if he had in this one black hour laid them down, it
would be to take them up again&mdash;it <i>must</i> be so. All
Black&#8217;s own dogged will, plus his love and his faith in God
and in this man, were back there in the woods with
Red.</p>

<p>By and by he went back himself. Red was no longer
sitting on the log, he was standing by a tree, at the edge
of the plateau, looking off through a narrow vista at the
blue hills in the distance all but veiled now in the dimness
of the coming night. At the sound of Black&#8217;s footsteps
on the snapping twigs he turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, lad,&#8221; he said, in a weary voice which was yet
quite his own, &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve won out over my particular
personal devil this time. I <i>have</i> &#8216;preached to others&#8217;&mdash;I
expect I&#8217;ve got to stand by my own preaching now. It&#8217;s
all right. I&#8217;d got too used to having my own way&mdash;or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
forcing it&mdash;that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ll try to take my medicine like
a man. I&#8217;ve been taking it&mdash;like a coward. Now&mdash;we&#8217;ll
say no more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not another word. Except&mdash;would you mind if I
built a little fire, and burned up those chips?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>With quick motions Black made a heap of them on the
old campfire ashes, touched them off with the match Red
silently handed him&mdash;he had matches of his own, but he
took Red&#8217;s&mdash;and stood looking down into the curling
flames. The chips burned as merrily and brilliantly as if
they had not been the signs of human despair, and the
two men watched till the small fire had burned down to a
last orange glow of embers.</p>

<p>Then Black, taking off his hat, said in a way so simple
that the listening ears could not want to be stopped from
the sound of the words: &#8220;Please, Lord, help us to run,
&#8216;<i>not uncertainly</i>,&#8217; nor fight, as those that &#8216;<i>beat the air</i>.&#8217;
Give us faith and courage for the long way&mdash;and bring us
to the end of the course, by and by&mdash;but not till we have
&#8216;<i>run a good race</i>&#8217;&mdash;all the way. Amen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still silently, after that, the two went down the trail,
now in deep shadow. Red went first, to lead the way,
and Black noted with joy that he plunged along down the
trail with much his old vigour of step. At almost the bottom
he suddenly halted and turned:</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Bob Black,&#8221; he said, accusingly. &#8220;I thought
you were on your way to the station when I saw you this
morning. Weren&#8217;t you off for those doings at your old
Alma Mater you&#8217;ve been counting on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I changed my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! After you saw me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>There was an instant&#8217;s stunned silence on the red-headed
doctor&#8217;s part, broken by Black&#8217;s laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;One would think you never gave up a play or a good
dinner or almost anything you&#8217;d wanted, to go and set a
broken leg&mdash;or to reduce a dislocated shoulder before
breakfast!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Red finally spoke the hoarseness was back
in his voice&mdash;only it seemed to be a different sort of
hoarseness:</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you know. Because I wanted to stand by
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Red turned again, and began to go on down the trail.
But at the bottom he once more stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lad,&#8221; he said, with some diffidence, &#8220;there&#8217;s a story
in that Book of yours&mdash;the other part of it&mdash;that always
interested me, only I didn&#8217;t think there were many examples
of that sort of standing by in present days. I
begin to think there may be one or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which story is that?&#8221; Black asked, eagerly&mdash;though
he concealed the eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&mdash;I&#8217;ll have to leave you to guess!&#8221; said the other
man&mdash;and said not another word all the way home. He
sent the car at its swiftest pace along the road, took Black
to his own door, held his hand for an instant in a hard
grip, said &#8220;Good-night!&#8221; in his very gruffest tone, and
left him.</p>

<p>But Black had guessed. And he had won his friend&mdash;for
good and all, now&mdash;he was sure of that. How could
it be otherwise?</p>

<small>SOMETHING TO REMEMBER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Robert Black</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Where do you suppose your letter reached me, telling me of
your rapidly maturing plans to go to France? At a place not
fifty miles away from you, where I have taken a small seaside
cottage for the summer! Yes, I did it deliberately, hoping it
might mean that I should see you often&mdash;for I have missed you
more than I quite venture to tell you. And now&mdash;I am not to
see you after all, for you are to be off at almost any time. My
disappointment is as great as my pride in you&mdash;and my joy that
you are responding to this greatest need of our time. I know you
will fully understand this seeming paradox.</p>

<p>Since I have no son to send&mdash;and you no mother to send you&mdash;and
since, as you well know, you have come to seem more like a
son to me than I could have thought possible after the loss of my
own&mdash;won&#8217;t you spend at least a day with me&mdash;right away, lest
your summons to join your regiment arrive sooner than you
expect? Please wire or telephone me&mdash;as soon as you receive
this, won&#8217;t you?&mdash;that you are coming. I have my faithful
Sarah with me, so you are assured of certain good things to eat
for which I recall your fondness. But I am very sure that
I do not have to bribe you to do this kind thing for an old
woman who cares for you very much. I know that Scotch
heart of yours&mdash;cool enough on the outside to deceive the very
elect, but warm within with a great friendliness for all who
need you.</p>

<p>With the belief that a long talk together will do away with the
need for a further exchange of letters just now, I am, as always,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="indentright">Faithfully and affectionately yours,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Marie L&#8217;Armand Devoe</span>.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Sitting on the edge of his study desk Black had
eagerly read this letter, written in a firm hand full of
character, not at all indicative of its being the penmanship
of &#8220;an old woman.&#8221; His face had lighted with pleasure,
and he had laid the letter down only to turn to consult
his schedule of work for the week. This was Monday,
the only day he was accustomed to try to keep free for
himself&mdash;usually with small success, it must be acknowledged.
But at least there was no engagement for the
evening, and it was the only evening of the week of which
that could be said.</p>

<p>During the next half-hour he did some telephoning,
held a brief interview with Mrs. Hodder, wrote a short
letter, then was off for his train. He had decided to take
a local into the city earlier than was necessary to make
his connection, in order that he might be safely away before
anything happened to detain him. This would give
him an hour to spare there before he could get the second
train, which would bring him within walking distance of
the little seaside village and his friend&#8217;s new summer home.
He would call her up from the city; he had not yet had
time to do it. He was glad of the extra hour in which to
draw breath and congratulate himself that this Monday
was to be a real day of rest. He was obliged to admit to
himself that it would taste rather good. What with
preaching and parish work doggedly kept up to the customary
standard, while he had been at the same time deep
in the involved details of securing his chance to go overseas&mdash;which
now was practically assured&mdash;he was feeling
just a trifle played out on this warm July morning.</p>

<p>Turning a corner just before he reached the station,
he came suddenly upon Jane Ray. Though her answering
smile was bright enough, he thought he saw in her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
a reflection of the weariness of which he himself was momently
more conscious. The heat for several weeks now
had been unusually trying. Jane had been quite as
busy as Black himself with the arranging to dispose of her
business preparatory to going abroad. She, too, had found&mdash;or
made&mdash;her chance. It looked as if she might get
off before any of them&mdash;except Cary, who was due to go
now at any time.</p>

<p>Black stopped short, in the shade of a great elm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you for two weeks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That
ought to be excuse enough for stopping you now? I
suppose you know I&#8217;ve been around twice&mdash;only to find
the shop locked, and the bell apparently out of commission,
for it produced nobody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; protested Jane. &#8220;I found your card both
times. If I hadn&#8217;t been so busy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221; He looked searchingly down into her face,
and it seemed to him it certainly looked a little worn.
Perhaps it was the lavender of the crisp linen dress which
sent trying reflections into her usually warm-tinted cheeks.
Perhaps it was the excessive heat, which incidentally was
doing its best to make her smooth hair curl riotously about
her ears in a particularly girlish fashion. &#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve
both been busy,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t make two
weeks seem any shorter to me. I&#8217;m going out of town
for the day, but with your permission I&#8217;ll try that doorbell
soon again. All at once, some day, either you or
I will get that call, and then&mdash;think of all the things we&#8217;ll
wish we had had time to say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps! Meanwhile, if you&#8217;re catching the 9:30,
Mr. Black, let me warn you that the station clock is two
minutes slow. I lost a train by it only yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus she had sent him off, for even as she spoke the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
whistle of the approaching local was heard down the line,
and Black had only time to take a hasty leave of her and
run to the platform, with no chance to buy his ticket.</p>

<p>Standing on the rear platform, as the train went on&mdash;the
inside of the car had been unbearably hot&mdash;he
looked back down the long street and caught a glimpse of
Jane&#8217;s lavender linen disappearing in the distance. He
strained his eyes to see it, visualizing clearly the face into
which he had just been looking. It was a face which had
a way of coming before that vision of his many times when
he was attempting to occupy himself with necessary work,
and of interfering seriously, now and then, with his powers
of concentration. There was something about the level
lines of Jane&#8217;s eyebrows, the curve of her cheek, the shape
of her mouth, which peculiarly haunted the memory, he
had found. It was astonishingly easy, also, to recall the
tones of her somewhat unusual voice, a voice with a &#8217;cello-like
low resonance in it; easy to recall it and easier yet
to wish to hear it again. He found himself suffering from
this wish just now, and rather poignantly.</p>

<p>Whose fault was it that he had not seen Jane for two
weeks? Since she must have known by his two calls that
he wanted to see her, why hadn&#8217;t she let him know he
might come again? The time was getting so horribly
short&mdash;the call for one or other of them might come so
soon. And then what? He was realizing keenly that
when the chance of turning a corner and meeting her, of
going to her shop and seeing her, of calling her upon the
wire and hearing her&mdash;was gone, perhaps forever&mdash;well&mdash;suddenly
the thought became insufferable. He must do
something about it, and that at once! He must do it to-day.
What could it be, since he was on his way out of
town?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>His thoughts went on rapidly. He made a plan, a daring
one&mdash;rejected it as too daring&mdash;decided that it wasn&#8217;t
half daring enough! What was the use of never doing
anything because there might be some possible and remote
reason why it wasn&#8217;t best? This infinite and everlasting
caution suddenly irked him&mdash;as it had many times before
in his experience&mdash;irked him till it became unbearable.
He would carry out his plan&mdash;his end of it. If Jane
wouldn&#8217;t carry out her end&mdash;&mdash; Well, anyhow he would
put it up to her. Thank heaven, he had that hour to
spare; it made possible the thing he had in mind.</p>

<p>The minute his train arrived in the city station he made
haste to the telephone, and shortly had Jane&#8217;s shop on the
wire, with Sue promising to call her mistress quickly. Then,
he was talking fast, and he feared less convincingly than
he could have wished, for Jane was objecting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Black&mdash;how <i>can</i> I? How could I, in any
case? And now, with so little time! Besides&mdash;are you
sure you&mdash;&mdash;And your friend&mdash;how can you know she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, this usually poised young business woman was
certainly being a trifle incoherent. No doubt it was an
extraordinary invitation she had received. It was small
wonder she was hesitating, as each phase of it presented
itself to her mind. Go with him, unbidden by his hostess,
to spend the day with him at her seaside home? What a
wild idea! But his eager voice broke in on her objections:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to call up Mrs. Devoe right now, and I
know as well as when I get her answer that she will welcome
you as heartily as you could ask. Why, she&#8217;s Southern,
you know, so any friend of mine&mdash;&mdash; And we&#8217;ll be back
in the early evening. Why shouldn&#8217;t you go? I can&#8217;t
see a possible reason why not. You wouldn&#8217;t hesitate,
would you&mdash;if it were any other&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And here he, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
became a victim of unfinished sentences, his anxiety to
put the plan through increasing, after the fashion of men,
with her seeming reluctance to allow him to do it. &#8220;Listen
please, Miss Ray. If you&#8217;ll be making ready, I&#8217;ll call you
again when I&#8217;ve had Mrs. Devoe&mdash;if I can get her quickly&mdash;and
assure you of her personal invitation. If she is in
the least reluctant&mdash;I&#8217;ll be honest and tell you so. You&#8217;ve
forty minutes to make your train, if you don&#8217;t lose any
time. Please!&#8221;</p>

<p>But all he could get was a doubtful: &#8220;I can&#8217;t promise,
Mr. Black&mdash;I can&#8217;t decide, all in an instant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;will you let me call you again, with Mrs. Devoe&#8217;s
invitation, if I get it in time? And will you call a
taxi, so that if you decide&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A low and heart-warming laugh came to him over the
wire: &#8220;Oh!&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do. I&#8217;m going to
hang up the receiver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! Will you be on the train? Won&#8217;t
you take a chance? I may not get my friend in time to
let you know, but I&#8217;ll surely have the message by the time
you join me. Just remember&mdash;won&#8217;t you?&mdash;that&mdash;I&#8217;m
going to France pretty soon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me!&#8221; And the receiver clicked in his ear.
It was high time. Two hurried people cannot talk over a
telephone and not be using up minutes of which they have
none too many.</p>

<p>The next half-hour Black spent in a manner calculated
both to warm his body and cool his spirit, if the latter
could have been readily cooled. In a smoking-hot telephone
booth he struggled with the intricacies of a system
temporarily in a snarl&mdash;of course it would have happened
on this particular morning. He did, at length, get Mrs.
Devoe on the wire. He cut short, as courteously as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
could, her rejoicings at the sound of his remembered voice,
and put his question. He received the cordial consent he
knew he should, though his reason told him she would have
preferred to see him alone. He was sorry&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t
help that&mdash;he would make it up to her as best he could.
But have this one day with Jane he must, if it could be
brought about.</p>

<p>When he emerged from the booth at last it was much
too late to get Jane, if she had left for her train. He
might call up the shop and find out what had been her
decision, and whether she was on her way, but somehow
he preferred not to do that. Rather would he cherish the
hope, until her train came in, that she was on it. Ten
minutes more, and he would know. Meanwhile&mdash;he
would try to cool off! Somehow&mdash;he had never been more
stirred by a possibility&mdash;never so looked forward to seeing
a train come in. If Jane would come, he felt that he
should be almost happier than he could bear and not show
it. If she did not come&mdash;how was he going to bear that?
Suddenly all his fate seemed hanging in the balance.
Absurd, when he had not the slightest intention of making
a day of fate of it! He couldn&#8217;t do that; he had decided
that long ago. It was only Jane&#8217;s friendship he had, or
could ask to have; that was about the biggest thing he
could want before he went away to the war. He was
sure she felt that way, as well as he. Without talking
about it at all, it had seemed to become understood between
them. Why, then, should he be so brought to a
tension by these plans for the day? He hardly knew&mdash;except
that he was becoming momentarily more anxious
to have them go through, and to find Jane on that hot
and dusty local and bear her away with him for one day to
the sea breezes. There could be no possible reason why he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
shouldn&#8217;t do it, with his good friend at the other end to
make it seemly.</p>

<p>The train came in. It is probable that could Robert
Black have caught a glimpse of the expression on his own
face as he watched the stream of passengers getting off,
he would have tried to look a shade less tense of eye and
mouth! He was hoping, it must be confessed, that if
Jane were there, there would be none of his parishioners
coming in by that same train. If there were some of
them aboard, however, he did not intend to attempt to
cover his very obvious purpose of meeting Miss Ray. If
there was one clause more emphatic than another in
Black&#8217;s code, it was the one in which he set forth his right
to do as his conscience and judgment sanctioned, provided
he did so with absolute frankness and openness. But
if he would brook no interference with his rights from
others, neither would he tolerate intrigue or deceit on his
own part.</p>

<p>Nobody whom he knew got off&mdash;the long line of passengers
had thinned to a final straggler. When he had
all but given her up, his heart sinking abominably&mdash;she
appeared at the door of the car, evidently detained by a
stranger asking information.... Was it the same
weary Jane whom he had seen in the morning? It couldn&#8217;t
be&mdash;this adorable young woman in the dark-blue summer
travelling garb, with the look about her he had always
noted of having been just freshly turned out by a most
capable personal maid. How did she manage it, she who
was accustomed to set her hand to so many practical affairs?
And how, especially, had she managed it this
morning of all mornings, when in an incredibly short space
of time&mdash;&mdash; Oh, well, it wasn&#8217;t that Black thought all these
things out; he just drank in the vision of her, after his hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
of uncertainty, and rejoiced that she was here&mdash;and that
she looked like that!</p>

<p>He smiled up at her, and she smiled back; it was like two
chums meeting, he thought. He had grasped her hand
before she was fairly down the last step of the car. The
coming holiday suddenly had become a festival, now that
she was here to share it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I oughtn&#8217;t to have come, you know,&#8221; she said, as they
walked down the platform together. &#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s
why I did come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know any reason why you oughtn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do&mdash;a big one. But I&#8217;m going to forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do. I appreciate your coming more than I can
tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked down at her, walking beside him among the
throng of strangers, and experienced a curious and entirely
new sense of possession. He was so accustomed to the
necessity of steering a strictly neutral course where women
were concerned, that to be off like this alone with this
amazingly attractive and interesting member of what was
to Black practically the forbidden class, was almost
an unprecedented experience. He was astonished to find
himself quite shaken with joy in the sense of her nearness,
and in the knowledge that for this day, at least, he might
be sure of many hours with her, never afterward to be forgotten.
Surely, that fact of the separation, so near at
hand, which might so easily be for good and all, justified
him in forcing the issue of this one day&#8217;s companionship,
whatever might be its outcome.</p>

<p>In the second train it was again too hot to think of taking
the fifty-minute ride in a stifling coach, and Black
again sought the rear platform, found it unoccupied, and
took Jane to it. The noise of the train made talking impossible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
and the pair swayed and clung to the rail in
silent company until at length the journey was over. They
alighted at a little breeze-swept station, the only passengers
for this point, which Mrs. Devoe had told Black was
a solitary one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-h!&#8221; Jane drew a long, refreshed breath. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
this delicious? How grateful I am to you for making me
come&mdash;now that I am here and feel this first wonder of
sea air. It&#8217;s ages since I&#8217;ve taken the time to get within
sight of the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say I made you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you did. Imposed your masculine will upon
mine, and brought me whither I would not&mdash;which sounds
scriptural, somehow&mdash;where did I get that phrase? All
the time I was dressing I was saying to myself that I not
only could not but would not. I am in the habit of making
my own decisions. I really can&#8217;t account for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can. This is to be a day of days in both your experience
and mine&mdash;it was for us to have, together, before
we go across where there can be no such days. Our friendship
is a thing that demands a chance to talk both our
affairs over in a way we never can back there. Don&#8217;t
you feel that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I suppose that was why I came. How straightforwardly
you put it&mdash;like your straightforward self!&mdash; Oh,
how glorious this is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her head was up, she was walking sturdily erect beside
him over a white road hard and smooth with ground clamshells,
that ideal road of the sea district. Far away
stretched the salt marshes, with a low-lying gray cottage
in the distance&mdash;the only one along a mile of coast. The
breeze, direct from the ocean, made the temperature seem
many degrees cooler than that of the inland left behind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? I haven&#8217;t known much about the sea since
my early boyhood. I was born on the east coast of Scotland,
and used to tumble around in the surf half my time,
wading or swimming. But that&#8217;s a pretty distant memory
now. I suppose I still could swim&mdash;one couldn&#8217;t forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;quite impossible. I was brought up to swim&mdash;and
ride&mdash;but it&#8217;s years since I&#8217;ve done either. How I&#8217;d
like to swim clear out into the blue over there! I suppose
nothing so wonderful could happen to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might&mdash;for you, anyhow. Mrs. Devoe undoubtedly
bathes here&mdash;she would have something to lend you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I somehow got the impression that she was an
old lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black laughed. &#8220;She calls herself old. As a matter
of fact, she&#8217;s the youngest person I know. Her hair is
perfectly white, but her eyes are unquestionably young&mdash;and
very beautiful. She is vigorous as a girl, and full of
the zest of life, though she insists she is old enough to be my
mother. I suppose she must be, for she had a son who
would have been my age if he&#8217;d lived. She is simply one
of those remarkable women who never grow old&mdash;and
her mind is one of the keenest I ever came up against. She
has been a wonderful friend to me, as she was to everybody
in my first parish, with her wealth, and her charm, and her
generosity, though she was only there part of the time, for
she&#8217;s a great traveller. You&#8217;ll like her&mdash;you can&#8217;t help
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall feel as if I were intruding horribly. She must
want to have a long talk with you alone&mdash;of course she
will. You must let me manage it, or I shall be sorry I
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you, certainly&mdash;though I&#8217;ve no doubt she would
manage it herself. She&#8217;s too clever to be defeated in getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
anything she wants as much as she and I both want
that talk. So don&#8217;t imagine yourself intruding. There
are few people who understand better the laws of friendship,
human and Divine, and nothing could make her
happier than to know that I&#8217;ve found another friend.
She&#8217;s always insisted that there were many people in
the world who knew what real friendship meant, but
I&#8217;ve doubted it. I still doubt it&mdash;in a way&mdash;but not
as I did before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the day began for them, with an entirely frank
understanding that before it was over they were to know
pretty well on what ground they stood. High ground it
was to be, no question of that. There was no hint in
Black&#8217;s language or in his manner of intended love-making,
but his intense interest both in the subject before them
and in Jane herself was very evident. It was quite
enough to make the day a vivid one for any such man
and woman. There are those who feel that there come
hours when the expression of the best and finest friendship
may surpass in beauty and in quality the more intimate
revelations of a declared love. However that may be,
it can hardly be denied that the early approaches of
one spirit to another may contain an exquisite and
unapproachable surprise and joy, to remain in
memory in the whitest light that shines in a world
of shadow.</p>

<p>There is no space to tell the whole story of that day.
Of the arrival at the cottage&mdash;hardly a cottage, it stretched
so far its long gray porches in a roomy hospitality&mdash;it
can only be said that its welcome proved as friendly as
the personality of its hostess. Mrs. Devoe put both arms
about the shoulders of Robert Black, greeting him as a
mother might have done. She gave Jane one smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
survey of discerning sweetness, said to Black, &#8220;She&#8217;s just
what I should expect a friend of yours to be, my dear,&#8221;
and bore Jane off to extend to her every comfort a traveller
on a July day might need. Returning, having left Jane
for the moment in a cool guest room, she questioned the
man as one who must know her ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much does this mean, and just what do you want
of me, Robert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know quite what it means, Mrs. Devoe&mdash;except
that she and I like very much to be together&mdash;and
we are both going to France soon. It may be a very long
time before we can spend a day together again. It seemed
to me we had to have the day. And all I want of you is to
let me have part of it with you&mdash;and part of it with her&mdash;and
understand that I&#8217;m so glad to be near someone who
feels like a mother that I&#8217;d have come five times as far for
one hour with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;I know. We have missed each other.
But before we begin our talk&mdash;it&#8217;s just the hour for the
morning swim. Will you and Miss Ray go in, while I
sit on the beach under my big sun umbrella and watch
you? I&#8217;m not going in now; I had an early morning dip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you manage it&mdash;for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. I keep several extra suits here, and Sarah
has them all in the nicest order for guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was more than he could have imagined hoping for
when the subject was first mentioned. What could have
been more glorious than to dash down the beach, and find
Jane, in the prettiest little blue-and-gray swimming clothes
in the world, already floating out on the crest of a great
wave? All his early sea training came back to him as he
plunged under a lazy comber, and swam eagerly out to join
the blue-and-gray figure with the white arms and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
wonderful laugh he had never heard make such music from
her lips before.</p>

<p>&#8220;If not another thing happens to-day, this will have
made it quite perfect,&#8221; Jane declared, swimming with
smooth strokes by his side toward shore, after a half-hour
of alternate work and play in the blue depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly will. I&#8217;m a new man already&mdash;feel like a
sea-god, in spite of aching muscles. It takes an entirely
new set to swim with, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. What a pity one can&#8217;t have swimming
pools brought to one&#8217;s door, like fish, when the wish takes
one, on a July day. What a dear your Mrs. Devoe is
to think of this the very instant we appear. I don&#8217;t
wonder you love her, she&#8217;s so very attractive to look at,
and so young, in spite of her years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody like her&mdash;you&#8217;ll be confident of that
when you&#8217;ve known her just one day. What I owe her&mdash;I
could never tell you&mdash;and hardly myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane was sure of it. She began to understand at once
certain qualities she had long since noted in Robert
Black. The explanation now was easy: he had been under
unconscious training from Mrs. Devoe, his friend. She
had been to him, for those five years during which he had
served his first parish, not only the mother he had missed
but the stimulus he had needed to bring out his best attributes
of mind and heart. That she had done this for
many another, first and last, lessened not a whit his debt
to her. Somehow he had never been more conscious of
this debt than he was to-day, upon seeing her again after
the interval of more than a year.</p>

<p>After luncheon&mdash;a refreshing affair partaken of on the
airy end of the seaside porch&mdash;Black had his hour with
Mrs. Devoe while Jane wandered off down the beach,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
taking herself out of sight and sound around a rocky curve.
In spite of his eagerness to be with Jane, Black enjoyed
that hour to the full, for it meant that he could pour out
to this perfect confidante the story of his year amid the
new surroundings, and feel as of old her understanding and
sympathy, as well as experience afresh her power to show
him where he lacked. But it was only for a little that
they discussed the affairs of the new parish; both were too
full of the bigger challenge to service Black had received,
and all that it might mean. <i>France!</i> That was the burden
of their talk together, and when it ended both were glowing
with the stimulus each had received from the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may go myself,&#8221; Mrs. Devoe said, looking off longingly
across the sparkling blue waters as she rose from her
low porch chair, at the end of the hour, ready to send her
companion off before he should want to go&mdash;one of the
little secrets of her charm, perhaps! &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t
I spend one or two of the last of my active years in work
like that? Many women of my age are in service over
there&mdash;and I can manage things&mdash;and people, can&#8217;t I,
Robert?&mdash;and get any amount of work out of them without
making them cross at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her beautiful eyes were sparkling as they met his.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do anything,&#8221; he said with reverence. &#8220;If
you should choose to do that, it would be the greatest
service of a life that has been just one long service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ve always thought too well of me. If I&#8217;ve
loved my fellowmen&mdash;and women&mdash;it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve found
that there&#8217;s nothing in life but that&mdash;and the love of their
Maker. I&#8217;ve been selfish, really, for I never gave without
getting back ten&mdash;twenty&mdash;a hundred fold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a reason for that,&#8221; he said with a smile.</p>

<p>She sent him away then, pointing in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
Jane had gone. He went almost reluctantly&mdash;which was
perhaps the greatest tribute to her hold upon him he could
have given her. In truth she was the only woman of
any age he had ever known intimately, and to go back to
Jane, from her, was like leaving home to adventure in the
unknown.</p>

<p>But the unknown has its lure for any man&mdash;and this
particular unknown drew Robert Black with rapid footsteps
once he had started in its direction. He had quite a
walk before he came upon her, for Jane had gone on and
on, following curve after curve of the shore, around one
rocky barrier after another. When he caught sight of her
at last she was standing upon a great rock, in the shadow
of the cliff towering above her, watching a distant ship
which was almost hull down upon the horizon.</p>

<p>Young and strong and intensely vital she looked to him
as she stood there, her face and figure outlined in profile
against the dark cliff. The morning swim and the sea
air had brought all its most vivid colouring into her face;
the light breeze blew her skirts back from her lithe limbs;
she might have been posed for a statue of Liberty, or
Victory, or anything symbolic of ardent purpose. And
yet he was sure it was no pose, for she did not hold it an
instant after his call to her, but came running down the
sloping rocks with the sure foot of youth and perfect
health, her voice that of warm joy in the hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve not been so happy in months&mdash;years!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know why. It&#8217;s just sheer delight in being
alive, I think, in the midst of all this wonder of sea
and sky and air. How can I ever thank you for bringing
me down here? It was what I needed to put the breath
of life back into me, after all these weeks of work and
bother over closing up and getting away. This morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
when you met me, I almost didn&#8217;t want to go to France&mdash;can
you believe that?&mdash;after all my preparation! And
now&mdash;oh! I&#8217;ve just been standing here watching that
ship go out, and imagining myself on her, with the ocean
breeze blowing in my face as it&#8217;s been blowing here&mdash;only
stiffer and stronger as we got farther and farther out.
And now&mdash;I can hardly wait to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked into her face, and met her eyes&mdash;and gave her
back her radiant smile. And then, suddenly, he didn&#8217;t
feel at all like smiling. Rather, his heart began to sink
at thought of the separation so near at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, please,&#8221; he said, &#8220;let&#8217;s sit down over here in
the shade, though you look just now as if you belonged
nowhere but in the brightest sunshine. I want to talk
it all out. And this is our hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found a seat for her where she could lean against
a smooth rock. Then he took his own place, just below
her and a little farther back, so that as they both looked
out to sea he could study her side face&mdash;if she did not turn
it too far away. It was rather clever of him, and highly
characteristic, if he had known it, of the male mind when
making its arrangements for a critical interview. Jane
might easily have defeated him in it, but she did not.
Perhaps she knew that to talk as freely as he seemed to
want to talk he must have a little the advantage of her
as to the chance for observation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why it is,&#8221; he began, slowly, and with
astonishing directness, much as he was accustomed to do
everything, &#8220;but it seems to me that the only way I can
possibly make clear to you something you must know, is
just simply to state it&mdash;and ask your help. I&#8217;ve thought
of every other way, and I find I don&#8217;t know how to use
them. I haven&#8217;t been brought up to feel my way, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
to cut a straight path. So&mdash;I&#8217;m going to tell you that&mdash;I
find it very hard not to ask you to marry me, because
I never wanted to do anything as I want to do that.
I think it is your right to know that I want to do it&mdash;and
why I&mdash;can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an instant&#8217;s silence, while Jane gazed steadily
out to sea, her side face, as he looked hard and anxiously
at it, that of one who had received no shock of surprise
or sorrow. Instead, a shadow of a smile slowly curved the
corners of her sweet, characterful mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Robert Black,&#8221; she said, without turning
toward him at all. &#8220;Whatever else I have or don&#8217;t have,
in life, I shall always have that to remember&mdash;that you
wanted me. But of course I know, quite as well as you
do, that you are not for me&mdash;nor I for you. I have understood
that perfectly, all along. You really didn&#8217;t have
to tell me. But&mdash;I can&#8217;t help being glad you did.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, indeed, there fell a silence. Where was the
&#8220;talk&#8221; Black had thought he was to have, carefully unfolding
to her the reasons&mdash;or rather the great reason&mdash;why
he couldn&#8217;t ask her for herself, but only for her lasting
friendship&mdash;for this was what he meant to ask for, in full
measure. Was it all said, in those few words? It seemed
so&mdash;and more than said. There was nothing to explain&mdash;she
understood, and accepted his decision. That was all
there was of it. Was it?</p>

<p>As he sat there, staring out at the incoming waves, each
seeming to wash a little higher on the beach than the last,
her simple words all at once took on new meaning. Why
was she glad he had told her? Why should she say that
she <i>had that to remember</i>?&mdash;as if it were something very
precious to remember? No real woman could be so glad
as that just to hear a man say he wanted her&mdash;even though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
he could not have her&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash; Yes, there was revelation
in those words of hers&mdash;even quiet, straightforward
confession, such as his straightforwardness called for. He
had virtually told her that he loved her, though he had
carefully refrained from using the phrase which is wont
to unlock the doors of restraint. Well, in return, she had
virtually told him&mdash;yes, hadn&#8217;t she?&mdash;else why should she
be glad of his words to remember?</p>

<p>The thought shook him, as he had never dreamed he
could be shaken. He had believed he could keep firm
hold of himself throughout this interview, in which he was
to tell a woman that in asking for nothing but her friendship
he was withholding the greater asking only because
he must. But now that he knew&mdash;or thought he knew&mdash;that
she cared, too&mdash;&mdash; Suddenly he drew a great breath
of pain and longing, and folded his arms upon his knees
which were drawn up before him, and laid his head down
upon them.</p>

<p>After a minute Jane spoke: &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind&mdash;too much,&#8221;
she said, and the sound of her low voice thrilled him
through and through. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal just to know that
the biggest thing there is has come to one, even though
one can&#8217;t have it to keep. And yet, in a way, one can
have it to keep. I have something to take with me to
France now&mdash;that I couldn&#8217;t have hoped to have. Perhaps
you have something, too. I am trying to give it to
you, without actually saying it&mdash;just as you have given
it to me without actually saying it. I think that&#8217;s only
fair. And I want you to know that I do perfectly understand
why you can&#8217;t say more. You can no more ask me
to marry you than&mdash;I could marry you, if you did ask me.
For I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;Robert Black&mdash;even though&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his head, his eyes full of a wild will to know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
what she would say. &#8220;Even though&mdash;<i>what</i>?&#8221; he asked,
in a voice which would not be denied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I say&mdash;what you do not?&#8221; she asked, with
that strange little smile of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I mustn&#8217;t say it. But now that you&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
I&#8217;ll say it, if you want to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. You might at least give me that to keep, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; He turned and looked straight into her uplifted
eyes. Then he said the words&mdash;that he had thought
he wouldn&#8217;t say. And he heard the answer. After that
he didn&#8217;t know how time passed, because there seemed to
be no time any more&mdash;just eternity, which was soon to
separate them.</p>

<p>Then, all at once: &#8220;Jane,&#8221; he said, heavily, &#8220;perhaps
some time&mdash;when you have been through&mdash;what you will
go through over there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;It would never make me&mdash;what
I should have to be to fill the place your wife must fill.
You couldn&#8217;t have a hypocrite taking that place&mdash;and I
couldn&#8217;t play the part of one. There&#8217;s a great gulf fixed
between us&mdash;no doubt of that. I can&#8217;t accept your beliefs&mdash;and
you can&#8217;t accept my&mdash;lack of them. It will
always be so. As long as I can never say a prayer&mdash;and
as long as you live by prayer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;how glad you were
to have a prayer said over Sadie Dunstan?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;Because it meant the difference between
custom and outrageous ignoring of custom. And I liked
the prayer, and respected your belief in it. But&mdash;I didn&#8217;t
for a moment think any one but ourselves heard it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometime,&#8221; he said again, sturdily, &#8220;you will pray,
and be glad to pray. And you will know that Someone
hears.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;When I do&#8221;&mdash;her voice softened incredibly&mdash;&#8220;I will
let you know. And&mdash;in a way&mdash;it isn&#8217;t true when I say
that I don&#8217;t believe in prayer, because&mdash;I could so easily,
this very minute&mdash;pray to&mdash;<i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me!&#8221; he repeated unsteadily and incredulously.
&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what&mdash;you think&mdash;you mustn&#8217;t give me. Yet&mdash;since
we are going so far away from each other&mdash;so soon&mdash;and&mdash;since&mdash;the
kind of chaplain you will be is just as
likely to get&mdash;a bullet through his splendid heart as any
other man&mdash;I almost think&mdash;you might give it to me.
It is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He had to bend to catch the words, the heart she
had mentioned beating like mad in his breast with what
might almost have been a bullet through it, for the shock
of it. &#8220;It is&mdash;so little for you to give&mdash;and so much&mdash;for
me&mdash;to have! And I know&mdash;with your dreadful Scotch
ideas of what mustn&#8217;t be, you will never, never think
you can give it to me unless I&mdash;pray for it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still as a statue, except for his difficult breathing,
while she waited, her head down and turned away, a wonderful
deep flush overspreading all her cheek and neck.
Then, at last, he spoke, in a whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t &#8216;<i>little for me to give</i>.&#8217; It&#8217;s&mdash;all I have.&mdash;I didn&#8217;t
think&mdash;didn&#8217;t dream&mdash;I could give it to you unless I gave
you&mdash;myself with it. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up then. Her lips were smiling a little, and
her eyes were full of tears&mdash;it was a glorious face she
showed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always knew the Scotch were cautious,&#8221; she breathed,
&#8220;and sometimes a trifle&mdash;close. But I didn&#8217;t think they
would hesitate so over a &#8216;bit gift&#8217;&mdash;when&mdash;they were
withholding&mdash;so much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She hadn&#8217;t finished the words before his lips met hers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
And when this had happened, it was she who got swiftly
to her feet. He rose also, but more slowly, and with a
strange film across his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, breathing a little quickly, but with
the old control coming back long before he could get hold
of his, &#8220;we&#8217;re quite all right, I think. We&#8217;re on a firm
basis of friendship for the rest of our days, and everything
completely understood. It goes without saying
that this was&mdash;<i>something to remember</i>, and only that.
Shall we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Robert Black reached out and caught her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want you to listen&mdash;listen with
your heart, not with your reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, with his head bared, he lifted it, as he had lifted
it in the woods with Red. &#8220;O my God,&#8221; he said, &#8220;teach
her&mdash;show her&mdash;somehow&mdash;Thyself. For she must learn,
and I can&#8217;t teach&mdash;this. Over there, if not here&mdash;show
her that she is all wrong, and that Thou <i>art</i> real, and
&#8216;nearer than breathing, nearer than hands and feet.&#8217;
Until then&mdash;keep her safe&mdash;<i>for me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. Jane was staring straight out to
sea, and on her face was he knew not what of mingled longing,
appeal, and protest. Her fine brows were drawn together,
her lips were caught between her beautiful white
teeth. She turned upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Black,&#8221; she said, low and fiercely, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never
say I believe God heard that&mdash;oh, yes, I know there is a
God&mdash;but I&#8217;ll never say I believe He heard, or cared&mdash;until
I do believe it, not even if it would give me&mdash;you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; answered Robert Black, steadily, &#8220;would
never ask you to say it till you do believe it&mdash;not even
if it would give me&mdash;you!&#8221;</p>

<small>QUICKSILVER IN A TUBE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WHERE away, Miss Lockhart? May I come along
a bit?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan turned, to see Cary Ray&#8217;s tall figure falling into
step beside her, his clean-cut face wearing the look of intent
purpose which was now so marked upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you may. I&#8217;m going to the station to meet
Fanny. You knew her uncle died, and she went West to
the funeral? She&#8217;s coming back to stay a few more days
with me before she goes to join her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard about the uncle. Is it a serious loss for her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he supplied Mrs. Fitch and Fanny with most
of their funds, but I think they seldom saw him. He was
rather eccentric and a good deal of a recluse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope the funds continue, anyhow,&#8221; said Cary,
lightly, &#8220;in the shape of a big bequest. That will alleviate
the sense of loss, besides providing a tender memory.
These recluse uncles with large bank accounts and generous
dispositions are all too uncommon&mdash;I never saw the
shadow of one. If I only had one now! How I&#8217;d leap
to make him a farewell visit&mdash;in uniform&mdash;if I ever get
mine. I&#8217;m mightily afraid I shan&#8217;t get it, by the way,
till I&#8217;m about to sail, so I&#8217;ll have no chance to strut around
this town and call on you all with an air of conscious
modesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; laughed Nan. &#8220;But we&#8217;re quite sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
impressed now just by the knowledge that you&#8217;ll soon
be off. What is the war-correspondent&#8217;s insignia, do you
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two fountain pens, crossed, on the collar, and a large
splotch of ink on the left sleeve,&#8221; announced Cary,
promptly. &#8220;Also, in time, presumably, a three-cornered
tear over the right knee, and a couple of black eyes, from
trying to push to the rear out of danger while rapidly
taking notes on what a highly developed imagination
assures him is undoubtedly occurring at the front.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great! My imagination, though not so highly developed,
pictures a quite different scene.... Oh, isn&#8217;t
that the train coming in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is. The station clock lies, as usual. We must
sprint for it if we want to be on the platform.&#8221;</p>

<p>They quickened their steps, and were in time to see
Frances Fitch appear in the vestibule of her car, and to
stare up at her with surprised and&mdash;at least in Cary&#8217;s case&mdash;appreciative
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Fanny!&#8221; It was Nan Lockhart&#8217;s inner cry to her
incomprehensible friend, though her lips made no comment.
&#8220;How <i>could</i> you? Don&#8217;t you think we must
<i>know</i> you&#8217;re acting? You don&#8217;t care enough for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Fanny was apparently in mourning, certainly in
black, the most simple but effective black the eye and hand
of skilled dressmaker and milliner could conceive, and in
it she was undeniably a picture. Not all the cunning
frills and artful colour combinations of her former dressing
could approach in the setting forth of her blonde beauty
the unrelieved black silks and misty chiffons of this new
garb. To Nan&#8217;s sophisticated eye Fanny&#8217;s mourning was
something of a travesty, for it was all of materials not
ordinarily considered available for the trappings of woe;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
but it was undoubtedly only the more effective for that.
Perhaps, Nan acknowledged, in that first quick glance,
it represented the precise shade of honour due a recluse
uncle who had been represented in his niece&#8217;s life principally
by monthly cheques and not at all by intimate
association.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word, but she&#8217;s a ripping beauty in that black,
isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; came from Cary Ray under his breath, as he
waved an eager greeting at the girl above him, and received
an answering smile slightly touched with pensiveness.
&#8220;Looks as if she&#8217;d been pretty unhappy, too. He
was about all she had in the world, anyhow, wasn&#8217;t he?&mdash;except
the invalid mother. Poor girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan smothered a sigh. Thus was Fanny wont to carry
off the interest and sympathy of the spectator, whatever
she did, on the stage or off it&mdash;if she was ever really off
the stage. Miss Lockhart now spoke sternly to her inner
self: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a prig, Nancy! Admit she&#8217;s perfectly
stunning to look at, and she has the right to mourn her
uncle if she wants to. She didn&#8217;t have to make a dowd
of herself to do it, just so other women wouldn&#8217;t be envious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she is a beauty,&#8221; she answered, in her usual
generous way. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sure it was a great loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she found herself almost instantly a supernumerary,
as she was quite accustomed to be when with
her friend in the company of any man on earth. After
one ardent embrace, during which Fanny murmured the
most affectionate of greetings in her ear&mdash;&#8220;You old darling&mdash;what
it <i>means</i> to get back to <i>you</i>!&#8221;&mdash;it was Cary
to whom the newcomer turned, and toward whom she
remained turned&mdash;so to speak&mdash;throughout the walk
home. Nan had to concede to herself, as she kept pace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
with the pair beside her, that Cary was doing his part
most thoroughly, and that Fanny could not justly be
blamed for giving him her attention. Before they had
reached the house it began to look to Nan as if Fanny&#8217;s
mourning had gone to Cary&#8217;s head!</p>

<p>She left them in the library, knowing well what was
expected of her, and went upstairs wondering, as she had
wondered a thousand times before, just why she cared so
much for Fanny Fitch. And then, as a thousand times
before, she found the explanation. To do Fanny entire
justice, she was not one of the girls who find no time or
taste for others of their own sex. Nobody could be more
fascinating than she to Nan herself, when quite alone with
her. Never down at heel or ragged at elbow in moments
of privacy, always making herself charming from sheer
love of her own alluring image in the mirror, capable of
the most clever and entertaining talk when the mood took
her, though there might be no man&#8217;s eye or ear within reach&mdash;it
was impossible not indeed quite to adore her. Nan&#8217;s
soberer yet highly intelligent self found a curiously satisfying
complement at times in Fanny&#8217;s lighter but far more
versatile personality. It was only when the more irresponsible
and reckless side of the other girl&#8217;s nature came
uppermost that Nan found herself critical and sometimes
deeply disapproving and resentful.</p>

<p>It was a full hour before Fanny came upstairs. Nan
had been waiting for her in the guest&#8217;s room, where she
had had the luggage taken. As Fanny came in, the look
of her struck Nan afresh as being past all precedent attractive
and appealing. Her colour was now heightened,
evidently by the interview with Cary, and her eyes were
full of all manner of strange lights. She had not yet removed
her hat, and somehow the whole effect of her was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
that of one poised but a moment at a resting place on a
journey full of both excitement and peril.</p>

<p>The two met in the middle of the large and airy room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear&mdash;and aren&#8217;t you going to take off your hat
and settle down?&#8221; Nan put up her hand to remove the
demurely becoming hat in question. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you
take it off downstairs and rest your head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt better armoured for defense with it. Never mind
taking it off&mdash;I&#8217;m going out again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you need defense, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t one, when a determined young man wants to
marry one out of hand? I&#8217;ve only succeeded in putting
him off for an hour or two, at that. He says he may go
any day, and on seeing me just now he realized he couldn&#8217;t
go without leaving me behind securely tied. What do
you think of that, for a poor girl just from a funeral, to
be confronted with a wedding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Fanny&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said&mdash;&#8216;But, Cary&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; In fact, I never
got further than that, though I tried it ten times over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did you&mdash;give him any encouragement?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I? Well, now, knowing me&mdash;as you think you
do&mdash;what&#8217;s your idea of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nan studied her, without answering. Her gaze dropped
from Fanny&#8217;s face to her black-clad shoulder, then suddenly
she put her arm about that shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m forgetting,&#8221; she said, gravely, &#8220;that you have lost
a friend. I&#8217;m sorry. Somehow I didn&#8217;t expect to see
you in black, and can&#8217;t yet realize that it means bereavement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a subtle way of telling me that my particular
kind of black doesn&#8217;t wholly suggest bereavement! Well,
my dear&mdash;it seemed to me only decent to show some respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
to an old man who has been very decent to me, and
left me enough to buy silk stockings and pumps in which
to mourn him, to say nothing of other accessories. I
don&#8217;t think he would have approved of henrietta cloth
and cr&ecirc;pe&mdash;and besides&mdash;what I&#8217;m wearing suits me
better, don&#8217;t you think? How do you imagine it will
impress the Reverend Robert? I&#8217;ve already noted its
effect on one young man. Can I hope to make another
lose his head within the hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny walked over to the mirror and gave a touch or
two to her hair beneath the black hat-brim. Nan&#8217;s eyes
still followed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be used to your breath-taking statements,&#8221;
Nan observed, uneasily, &#8220;but I probably never shall be
any more than I can become used to the covering up of
what I know is your real self with all this pretense of
lightness. You are sorry you have lost your uncle, but
one would never guess it. And you care&mdash;or don&#8217;t care&mdash;for
Cary Ray, and I haven&#8217;t an idea which. As for&mdash;the
crazy things you&#8217;ve said all along about&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hesitate to mention his name&mdash;I adore hearing
it. And I&#8217;m going to pronounce it myself to its owner
this very hour&mdash;if he&#8217;s at home. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m keeping
on my hat. And why&mdash;&#8221; Fanny dived into a small
and chastely elegant black leather travelling bag, and
after a moment&#8217;s searching brought forth two filmily fine
handkerchiefs which she tucked away in her dress&mdash;&#8220;why
I am providing myself with the wherewithal to weep upon.
I have no doubt that what the Reverend Robert says to
me will bring forth tears, and I want to be prepared. But
whether tears of joy or sorrow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny! You&#8217;re not&mdash;going to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My beloved Annette, the number of times in the course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
of my acquaintance with you that you have pronounced
the word &#8216;<i>Fanny!</i>&#8217; in precisely that tone of expostulatory
shock couldn&#8217;t be numbered!&mdash;I am going to him&mdash;since
I don&#8217;t know any way of making him come to me. Cary
happened to say that Mr. Black also was liable to be
called at any hour, and I dare not delay. I want to have
an important&mdash;very important&mdash;interview with him
while my courage is high. I told you, some time ago, that
I should find a way, and I&#8217;ve found it. Wish me good
luck!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all there was to it. Although Nan Lockhart
was more than anxious as to what might underlie Fanny&#8217;s
mystifying language, she could not doubt, when Fanny
presently set forth from the house, that she was going, as
she had declared, to the manse. It was by now four in
the afternoon. Nan had offered to accompany her friend,
saying that she thought, if Fanny must go, that she would
best not go alone. She had been told that she was a
meddling old granny, and that her place was by the fireside.
So&mdash;with a kiss&mdash;Miss Fitch had walked away, and
as Nan anxiously watched her go down the street she had
been forced to admit to herself, as she had admitted many
times before, that there was an unexplainable and irresistible
witchery about Fanny, and that there could be little
doubt that somebody was in danger. She wondered
which of them it was&mdash;if any could be in greater danger
than Fanny herself.</p>

<p>The master of the manse was at home when his bell
rang presently, so it fell out, though ten minutes before
he had not been there, nor would have been ten minutes
later. He had rushed in for a certain book he wanted,
and was just within his own front door when he heard the
bell. He opened it, his thoughts upon the book in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
hand&mdash;it was one on &#8220;Minor Tactics,&#8221; by the way, and
he wanted it for one of his boys. So he confronted his
caller with no means of escape&mdash;if he had wanted any.
Why mortal man should wish to escape from the vision
of sad-eyed beauty which awaited him upon his doorstep
none who had seen her there could say&mdash;certainly not
Cary Ray, who had seen her there, and who was now
stalking angrily up and down a side street, intent on keeping
her somehow within his reach. He knew that Fanny
had meant to come&mdash;had she not told him so? Why she
had not let him come with her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to delay you, Mr. Black, but&mdash;I need your
help very much. Will you let me come in for a very
few minutes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, Miss Fitch, come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>What else was there to do? All sorts and classes of
people were accustomed to enter the manse doors at all
hours, so why not this girl in black with the shadows under
her eyes and the note of appeal in her voice, who said she
needed his help? What was he there for, except to help?
And yet, somehow, Robert Black had never been quite
so unwilling to admit a visitor. Something within him
seemed to warn him that if ever he had been on his guard,
he must be on it now.</p>

<p>If Nan could have seen Fanny, as she took her seat in
the chair Black placed for her, she would have wondered
if she knew her friend, after all. This the girl with the
glitter in her eyes, the reckless note in her voice, the captivating
ways which Cary Ray knew so well? This was
a girl of another sort altogether; one in deep trouble, who
presented to the man before her a face so sadly sweet, lifted
to him eyes in which lay such depths of anxiety, that he
might well summon his best resources to her aid. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
ever sincerity looked out between lifted lashes, it showed
between those heavily shadowing ones which were among
Fanny&#8217;s most conscious and cherished possessions.</p>

<p>So then Fanny told Black her story. It was a touching
story, bravely told. Whenever the lines of it began to
verge too decidedly upon the pathetic she brought herself
up, as she caught her red lips between her teeth, said
softly, &#8220;Oh, never mind that part&mdash;it&#8217;s no different from
thousands of others,&#8221; and went quietly and clearly on.
She told him of the invalid mother, so dear and so helpless&mdash;of
the uncle who had died, the one man left in the
bereaved family, for whom she obviously wore her
mourning&mdash;&#8220;though he would have told me not, wonderful
old man, who wanted nobody to grieve for him.&#8221;
She spoke of the future, so obscure, and what it was best
to do; and now, suddenly, when she least expected it&mdash;she
hesitated, then came frankly out with it&mdash;here was this
suitor besieging her, whom she must answer. And with
it all&mdash;she was suffering a great longing for something
which she had not&mdash;a sense that there was a God who
cared, which she found it, oh! so difficult to believe.
This last was the greatest, much the greatest, need of all.
She had come to him because she knew no one else who
could point the way....</p>

<p>Here she rested her case, and sat silently looking
down at her hands clasped tightly in her lap, her face paling
with the stress of her repressed emotion. Yes, it did
pale, as well it might. When one dares to play with
sacred things, small wonder if the blood seeps away from
the capillaries, and the pulse beats fast and small. And
Fanny knew&mdash;who could know better?&mdash;that she was playing,
playing a desperate game, with the last cards she
held.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>It was very perfect acting, and yet, somehow, it did not
make the man who watched it lower his guard. He had
had no great experience with just this sort of thing, and
yet&mdash;he had seen Fanny act before, and had detected in her
acting that it never once forgot itself in the grip of a genuine
emotion. When she ceased speaking, and it became
necessary to answer her, he felt his way with every word
he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you told all this to Miss Lockhart?&#8221; was the
unexpected question he put to her.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly Fanny winced, but she replied quietly:
&#8220;Nan knows much, but not all. She doesn&#8217;t quite understand
me, I think. I can never make her realize that flippant
and frivolous as I can be on the surface, underneath
something runs deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet she must want to assure herself of that, she&#8217;s so
finely genuine herself. Ever since I have known her I
have thought her one of the best-balanced young women
I ever knew. She seems very devoted to you. And as
for her faith in things unseen, I am sure it is very real.
I don&#8217;t see how you could do better than to put yourself
under her tuition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried, Mr. Black&mdash;I assure you I have. Nan
and I are dear friends, and I respect and admire her devotedly.
But I can&#8217;t talk about these things even to her.
Somehow I can&#8217;t to any woman. I need&mdash;I think I need
a man&#8217;s point of view. And not only a man&#8217;s but&mdash;a
priest&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes lifted themselves slowly to his, and there was
a spiritual sort of beseeching in them which very nearly
veiled and covered the terribly human wish which was
behind. For a moment Black wondered with a heart-sinking
throb of anxiety if he were right in distrusting her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
motive in coming to him as he had thus far distrusted
it. How should he dare not to respond to her need, if it
were real? How send her from him unanswered and unsatisfied,
if he could really do anything for her? Why,
merely because she was fascinating to look upon, must she
be a deceiver; while if she sat before him with a plain face
and red, white-lashed eyes, he would be far surer that she
was in real distress. It wasn&#8217;t fair to her, was it, to
doubt her without the proof?</p>

<p>While he hesitated over what to say to this appeal, all
at once he was confronted with a new situation; one ever
calculated to weaken and undermine the judgment of man.
Fanny sat close beside his study desk, from the opposite
side of which he faced her. When his silence had lasted
for a full minute she quietly turned and laid her arm upon
the desk&mdash;a roundly white arm, the fair flesh showing
through the sheer black fabric of her close sleeve&mdash;and
buried her face in her arm. With her free hand she found
her handkerchief&mdash;one of the two with which she had
provided herself&mdash;and then Black saw that she was softly
sobbing, and seemingly trying with much difficulty to
control herself.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;was this acting, too? Can a woman weep at
will? And if she were as unhappy as she seemed, what
was he to do about it? It was an extremely uncomfortable
and disquieting situation, and Black wondered for a
moment if he could possibly see it through without
blundering. He was wishing ardently that he had a
mother or a sister at hand. There was only Mrs.
Hodder whom he could call in, and she was assuredly
not the person to act as duenna to this young woman.
To bring her in would be to send Fanny out. And was
it possible that this was really his opportunity, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
he must forget everything except to use it for all that there
was in it?</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you are unhappy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of course
it&#8217;s not possible for me to advise you as to Cary Ray&mdash;only
yourself can answer that question. I&#8217;ve grown to
like and respect him very thoroughly, and if you could be
to him what he needs in the way of a sheet anchor, it
would help him more than anything in the world to steer
a straight course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny lifted a tear-wet face. &#8220;Would you advise me
to marry him&mdash;without&mdash;loving him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I cared with all my heart and soul for&mdash;someone
else&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She rose suddenly to her feet, and stood before
him, a tragic, lovely figure of despair. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she breathed,
&#8220;you simply have to know&mdash;I can&#8217;t keep it from you.
You are going so soon&mdash;there&#8217;s no time to wait. I&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know what you will think, but&mdash;over there you are
going to go into all sorts of danger. I may never see you
again. Is it a time to be afraid&mdash;for even a woman to be
afraid&mdash;to speak? You may despise me for&mdash;showing my
heart&mdash;but&mdash;oh, I can&#8217;t help it! Don&#8217;t&mdash;turn me away.
If you do, I think I shall&mdash;die!&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Black stood as if turned to stone. He had risen
as she had risen; he now stood staring at her across the
massive old black walnut desk as if he could not believe
the evidence of his own ears. If Fanny were to make this
incredible declaration at all, she had done it in the only
possible way&mdash;across that study desk. If she had attempted
to come near him, to put her hand in his, to try
upon him the least of all feminine arts in approaching
man, he would have retreated, bodily and spiritually, and
have been at once too far away for her to reach. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the very manner of her appeal to him carried with it a
certain dignity. He could not conceivably repulse her
in the same way that he could have done if she had played
the temptress, or even the woman who counts upon her
personal charm at close range to sway a man&#8217;s heart and
influence his decision. Fanny had studied this man, and
gauged him well. If she had any possible chance with
him it was only by making her supplication to him from
a distance, and by looking, when she had made it&mdash;as she
did look&mdash;like a young princess who stoops to lift him of
her choice to her estate. It was undoubtedly the greatest
moment of Fanny&#8217;s dramatic experience; she was a real
actress now, for beyond all question she was living the
part she acted, and the emotion which stirred her was the
strongest of her life.</p>

<p>It was not long that Black stared at her white face, his
own face paling. It was only for a moment that she let
him see all she could show him; then she turned and walked
away, across the room, and stood with her back to him,
her hands clasped before her, her head drooping. The
figure she thus presented to him was still that of the princess,
but it was also that of the woman who, having for
the instant lifted the veil, drops it again, and awaits in
proud patience the man&#8217;s pronouncement.</p>

<p>Black came slowly toward her&mdash;it did not seem possible
courteously to address her across the many feet of space
she had now put between them. He stopped when he was
near enough&mdash;and not too near&mdash;he seemed to know rather
definitely when this point had been reached. But before
he could speak Fanny herself broke the stillness. She
put out one hand without turning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t come nearer,&#8221; she breathed. &#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;bear
it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>And then she did turn, lifting to him a face so beseeching,
lifting to him for one instant&#8217;s gesture arms so imploring,
that if there had been in him one impulse towards her
he would have been more than man if he had resisted her.
But&mdash;how could there be in him one impulse towards her
when, with every moment in her presence, there had been
living more vividly in his remembrance that other moment,
now days ago, when he had given Jane Ray&mdash;&#8220;all
he had.&#8221; Though never again&mdash;never again&mdash;should
even so brief a glory of experience come to him, rather
would he have that one wonderful memory than all
that there might be for him in these two outstretched
arms.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;how could he but be pitiful&mdash;and merciful&mdash;to
Fanny Fitch? To have offered herself to him, and to have
to stand there waiting to be taken or refused&mdash;there
seemed to him no words too kind in which to make her
understand. And yet&mdash;how to find words at all!</p>

<p>&#8220;You must know,&#8221; he said at last, and with difficulty,
&#8220;that I am&mdash;that I have&mdash;no way to tell you&mdash;how badly
I feel to have you tell me this, and to be&mdash;unable to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not unable&mdash;you&#8217;re just afraid. You&#8217;ve kept
your heart sealed up so long&mdash;you&#8217;ve been so frightfully
discreet&mdash;such a model minister&mdash;you don&#8217;t know at all
what you&#8217;re putting away from you. It will never
come back&mdash;you&#8217;ll never have the chance again I&#8217;m
giving you&mdash;to live&mdash;to <i>live</i>&mdash;oh, to live with all there is
of you, not just with the nice, proper, priestly side of you!&#8221;
The passionate voice lifted and dropped again in choking
cadences. &#8220;You think I couldn&#8217;t adapt myself, couldn&#8217;t
fill the part. I could&mdash;I could!&mdash;I would do anything
you asked of me&mdash;become a mystic, like yourself&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>stop</i>!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Fanny stopped&mdash;there was no disobeying that low,
commanding voice. She knew herself that she had now
gone too far. She stood with both hands pressed over
her throat, which threatened to contract and shut off
her breathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you&mdash;I won&#8217;t let you go on. You&#8217;re overwrought&mdash;you&#8217;re
not yourself, Miss Fitch. Your long
journey&mdash;your uncle&#8217;s death&mdash;Cary&#8217;s suit&mdash;everything
has combined to overtax your nerves. You&#8217;re going to
put away this hour as if it had never been, and so am I.
You&#8217;re going to find happiness in being a good friend
to Cary, whether or not anything comes of it. He&#8217;s
worth all you can give him&mdash;and you&#8217;re going to give him
your very best. Now&mdash;won&#8217;t you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away?&#8221; She looked up at him with a twisted,
angry smile. &#8220;Before you have&mdash;prayed with me, for
the good of my wicked soul? You might at least do that,
since it&#8217;s all you can do for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt as if he were in the midst of cheap
melodrama, forced to take a part against his will. He had
never believed in this girl, he believed in her less than ever
now. For a moment she had convinced him that in her
own fashion she loved him&mdash;if she knew what the word
meant. But now he was driven to believe that only her
passion for excitement had brought this scene upon him,
and that this last cynical speech was just the expression
of her fondness for the drama. He turned cold in an instant;
his very spirit retreated from her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should feel,&#8221; he said, very quietly, &#8220;as if I were
playing with prayer, if I made use of it just now. I think
the best thing for you is to try to rest and sleep, and come
back to a natural and sane way of looking at things. If
doors don&#8217;t open at a touch, if they are locked and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
has no key, it&#8217;s not wise to try to force them. There are
plenty of doors that will open at your touch&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not yours! And now that you have locked and
doubled barred it I want to tell you that it&#8217;s too late.
I&#8217;ve seen inside, and know what a chilly, stony place it is.
There&#8217;s no fire there&mdash;it&#8217;s all austerity. No woman could
keep warm there, certainly not a woman like me. I&#8217;ve
long wanted to know what was behind that granite face
of yours, and now I&#8217;ve found out. I&#8217;ve kept my splendid,
big-hearted Cary waiting till I could satisfy myself about
you, and know that he was worth two, three&mdash;ten of you,
Robert Black! I&#8217;m going back to him&mdash;and happy to
go. Do you wish me joy? Or does even doing that go
against your flinty conscience?&#8221;</p>

<p>He came toward her, pitying her again now, it was so
obvious that she was trying to save her humiliated face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Fitch,&#8221; he said, gently, &#8220;I do wish you joy&mdash;if
you can find it in anything genuine. But don&#8217;t play
with Cary Ray&mdash;he doesn&#8217;t deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you marry us to-night at eight o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly do. That was what I came for&mdash;as he
knows. And to settle a little wager I had with him. I&#8217;ve
settled it. And now I&#8217;m doing my real errand. Will
you marry us, Mr. Robert Black?&mdash;since you have refused&mdash;everything
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked away from her now, over to the window, and
stood looking out for a space. Fanny watched him, her
head up, her lips smiling a little, ready to face him when
he turned again. He came back at last, and he spoke
quietly and decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will send Cary to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and he asks
me to do this, I will do it. Not otherwise.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;What do you want to do? Talk with him, and try
to persuade him that I&#8217;m not good enough for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to talk with him. I want to ask him to wait
to marry you till he comes back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why, if you please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s going to find out, over there, that life is
something besides a game. And when he comes back, if he
still wants you, it will be because you have found it out,
too. Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish with all my heart&mdash;you would stop
playing and be real. Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Fanny Fitch, &#8220;it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m made
that way. You might as well give me up. If I laugh,
it&#8217;s as likely as not to be because I want to cry. And
if I cry, it&#8217;s more than likely to be true that I&#8217;m laughing
inside. I love to act, on the stage or off of it. How can
I help that? It&#8217;s the true dramatic instinct. How can
I be any more real than I am? Being what you call unreal
is reality to me. If I were to try to be what to you is
real, I should be more unreal than I am now. There,
Mr. Minister what will you do with that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black shook his head. &#8220;You are merely juggling with
words now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think you know what I mean
as well as I do. And I think something will happen
which will make you unwilling to play with things&mdash;and
people&mdash;as you do now. Meanwhile&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The doorbell rang sharply. It was what Black had
been expecting all along. There was nothing to do but
answer it. Mrs. Hodder was accustomed to do this only
by request, and he had not asked her for it to-day, for
she was more than usually busy in her kitchen. Black
went to the door, leaving Fanny behind, and hoping
against hope that it might not be some caller who would
be certain to misunderstand the whole situation. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
proved to be the one man whom he could have wished to
see. Cary Ray had walked the street to a purpose,
though he had not known, for he had met a messenger.
With his message in his hand he had rushed to the manse
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Fanny here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Come into my study, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Breathless with his fast walk which had been all but a
run, Cary confronted Fanny across the room. He crossed
it, seized her hands, and stood looking down into her face
with excited eyes. The drops stood out upon his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;You put me off too long,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m off&mdash;no
time for anything but to throw my things together and
catch the next train. I knew when the orders came they&#8217;d
come this way. There isn&#8217;t even time for&mdash;what we&#8217;d
have to get first if we did what I wanted. Perhaps&mdash;since
you didn&#8217;t know your own mind&mdash;it&#8217;s just as well. Maybe&mdash;if
I come back&mdash;you&#8217;ll know it better. And if I don&#8217;t&mdash;never
mind. All I want is to get into the game somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even at the moment Fanny looked past Cary at Robert
Black.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she said, &#8220;he calls it a game, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t,&#8221; Black answered, &#8220;when he comes back&mdash;as
please God he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stop a minute. Will you both go with me,
over to my sister&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black caught up his hat. Fanny snatched a glance at
herself as she went by a sombre black-walnut-framed
mirror in the hall. Cary mopped his brow and ran a
finger round inside his collar. It was quite plain that his
eagerness now was concentrated on the great news of his
imminent departure. Suddenly nothing much mattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
to him except that at last he was off, with his longed-for
chance before him. That was the big thing to him now,
not getting married in haste and leaving a bride behind
him. It was as plain as could be in every word he said,
and in the joyful sparkle in his eyes. Quicksilver in a
tube was Cary Ray&mdash;and the mercury had jumped all
but to the top!</p>

<p>The following hour was as wild a one as only those can
conceive who have had an experience like it. At the end
of it Cary and Jane, Fanny, Nan Lockhart, and Robert
Black stood on the station platform with six minutes to
spare. At almost the same instant Doctor Burns&#8217;s car
drew up, and he and Mrs. Burns joined the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all regular bricks, you know,&#8221; declared Cary,
&#8220;to stand by me like this. Everybody&#8217;s here I could have
wanted, except Tom, and since he beat me to a uniform,
and there&#8217;s no way of getting his training camp on the
wire in a hurry, I&#8217;ll have to go off unsped by him. But I
know what he&#8217;d say: &#8216;This is the life!&#8217; He&#8217;s said it to
me at least once a week on a postcard, ever since he left
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are half as happy to be in it as he is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began
Nan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m twice as happy&mdash;no question of it. And I want
to tell all you people&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Cary paused, looked quickly
from one to another, and his bright glance fell. &#8220;No, I
don&#8217;t believe I can,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;at least not in a group
like this. I think what little I can say I owe my sister.
If you&#8217;ll forgive me I&#8217;ll take her down the platform a bit
and give her my parting instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grasped her arm and walked away with her, the
friendly eyes following the pair. Friendly? Black couldn&#8217;t
help wondering just what Fanny was thinking as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
looked after them. Certainly she was paler than he had
ever seen her&mdash;or was that her unaccustomed sombre
attire?</p>

<p>&#8220;Sis,&#8221; Cary said in Jane&#8217;s ear, &#8220;it&#8217;s tough to go like
this, after all, with all the things I want to say left up in
the air. I hope you&#8217;ll somehow make those trumps back
there know what their friendship has meant to me.&mdash;I
say&mdash;&#8221; he broke off to stare at her&mdash;&#8220;by George! I didn&#8217;t
know you were so easy to look at, little girl. You&mdash;you&mdash;why
you&#8217;re the sweetest thing that ever happened&mdash;and
not just soft sweet, either&mdash;stingingly sweet, I should put
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, you&#8217;re just seeing me through the eyes of
parting. Cary, when I get across we can surely meet
sometimes, can&#8217;t we? Correspondents have more freedom
of movement than other men, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it, anyhow. Janie&mdash;I want you to know
how I just plain worship you for sticking by and pulling
me out of the ditch the way you have&mdash;you and Bob
Black, and the Doctor. Words can&#8217;t say it&mdash;but maybe
actions can. I&#8217;m taking you three with me&mdash;and leaving
behind a girl who doesn&#8217;t know whether she wants me or
not. Best thing to do&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, he was excited, strung to a high tension, eager to
be off&mdash;it could be read in his every word and look. He
had barely said these things to Jane before he had her
back with the others, and was getting off gay, daring
speeches to one and another, sometimes aloud, sometimes
under his breath for one ear only. The words he left with
Fanny Fitch stayed with her for many a day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get into the game, somehow&mdash;will you? You can do
that much for me, anyhow. If you will I&#8217;ll call it square&mdash;of
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>When he had gone, his handsome, eager face laughing
back at them from the rear platform of his train, Robert
Black found himself following Cary with an involuntary
&#8220;God bless and keep you safe, Cary Ray!&#8221; the more
fervent that it was unuttered. Suddenly his heart was
very anxious for this audacious and lovable fellow. How
would he come through? Yet it was not of Cary&#8217;s life
that he was thinking.</p>

<p>Determinedly he took his place beside Jane. The party
had dismissed their taxicab, now that the rush for the
train was over, and were walking back. It was no time
to allow circumstances or other people to come between
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how I wish,&#8221; breathed Jane, &#8220;that I could go
this very night. I want so much to get away before&mdash;you
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m wanting to go before you! If you go first
I shall see you off. If I go first, will you do the same for
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your whole church will be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if I can help it. But even if they are, it will make
no difference. I shall want to look last at&mdash;you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think,&#8221; admitted Jane, smiling, &#8220;that I
could possibly stay away?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>THE ALTAR OF HIS PURPOSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp; THINK maybe&mdash;it&#8217;s come, Mr. Black.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodder, housekeeper to the manse, stood
trembling in the study doorway, a telegram in her hand.
Yes, Mrs. Hodder was trembling. Robert Black would
never know how like a mother she felt toward him. A
lonely, more than middle-aged woman can&#8217;t bake and
brew and sew on buttons and generally look after a bachelor
of any sort without coming to have a strong interest
in him&mdash;normally a maternal one. And when the bachelor
is one who treats her with the consideration and friendliness
this man had always shown Henrietta Hodder, small
wonder if she comes to have a proprietary interest in
him little short of that belonging to actual kinship.</p>

<p>Black jumped up from his desk. It was Saturday night,
and his sermon was still in preparation. This was unusual
with him, but everything that could happen had happened,
this week, to consume his time and delay him. Everybody,
it seemed to him, in his parish, had needed his services
for some crisis or other. He was tired of body and
jaded of spirit, and he was extremely discontent with the
outlines for the sermon which he had with difficulty dragged
out of his unwilling mind. And now, in the twinkling
of an eye, everything was changed.</p>

<p>He read the message in one hurried instant. Yes, it
was here, couched in military language with military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
brevity. He was to proceed at once&mdash;nobody in the
Service is ever ordered to go anywhere, always to proceed&mdash;and
to report within forty-eight hours to his commanding
officer at a camp at a long distance. This meant&mdash;yes,
of course it meant&mdash;that he must leave town by the
following evening, Sunday evening. And it meant also,
equally of course, that between this hour and that he must
be practically every minute on the jump. Well, he
couldn&#8217;t but be glad of that.</p>

<p>His weariness vanished like magic. Mrs. Hodder,
watching him read the message, knew by the way he
stiffened and straightened those shoulders of his, which
had been humped over his desk when she came to the door,
that the expected call had come. He looked at her over
the yellow sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;this is it!&#8221; he said. &#8220;I must be off&mdash;to-morrow
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She swallowed a great lump in her throat. &#8220;I expect&mdash;there&#8217;ll
be a many things to do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
your clo&#8217;es in order&mdash;I&#8217;ve been keeping them mended up,
ready&mdash;your socks and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black smiled. It was on the tip of his tongue to tell her
that not an article of his ordinary apparel would go with
him to France, but he hadn&#8217;t the heart just then. It
struck him that Mrs. Hodder was looking a little odd to-night&mdash;strangely
pale for one whose countenance was
usually rather florid. Then&mdash;he saw her hand shake as
she put it up to smooth back her already smooth gray hair,
an act invariable with her when disturbed in mind. It
came over him that his housekeeper was not just happy
over his wonderful news. And suddenly, he almost understood
why. Not quite. How could he know what ravages
he had committed upon that staid, elderly heart?&mdash;he who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
had borne himself with such discretion under this roof
that he had never so much as touched the woman&#8217;s hand
except to shake it.</p>

<p>His own heart suffered, at this instant, its first pang
at the thought of leaving this comfortable home of his
and the ministrations of this plain person who had&mdash;yes,
she had done her best to mother him&mdash;he knew it now&mdash;as
far as a woman could who was shut away by all sorts of invisible
barriers from any real approach. He put out his
hand and took her trembling one and held it in both his
own. He was a chaplain now, he was leaving his parish,
he could do as his will dictated!</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I appreciate, as
well as a man can, every thought you have taken for me.
You&#8217;ve made this house seem as much like a real home as
you could possibly have done. I shall remember it
always.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pale? Had she been pale? She had flushed, in an odd,
mottled sort of way, to her very ears&mdash;and the back of her
neck. Her breath seemed to come a little short as she
answered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;you&#8217;ll be coming back, Mr. Black?&#8221; she questioned,
anxiously. &#8220;You&#8217;re only going for&mdash;a while?
I&#8217;ll&mdash;you&#8217;ll&mdash;I wanted to speak for the place again, if I
might, when&mdash;you come back, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black&#8217;s softening face hardened suddenly. &#8220;No, I
don&#8217;t expect to come back to this parish, Mrs. Hodder,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m resigning to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What&#8217;s that?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>A deep voice boomed from the hall outside, and Black
and Mrs. Hodder turned together. Red appeared in the
doorway of the study, having met the telegraph messenger
coming away just outside the house. He was, by now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
the sort of friend who follows up a telegraph messenger
on the chance that he may be needed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hodder knew her place, if momentarily her master
himself had caused her to forget it. She withdrew her
hand from Black&#8217;s and left the room hurriedly; and the
tears which flowed the moment she was out of sight were
not wholly unhappy ones. As for her hand&mdash;the hand he
had held so warmly in both his&mdash;well, it was a very precious
hand to her now. Like Jane Ray, she had &#8220;something
to remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say?&#8221; demanded Red, coming in like
a gathering tornado. &#8220;I know you&#8217;ve got your orders, or
you wouldn&#8217;t be found holding your housekeeper&#8217;s hand.
But&mdash;what in thunder do you mean by saying you&#8217;re
resigning your church?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black sat down on the edge of his desk&mdash;he was rather
glad to sit down on something if an argument with R. P.
Burns in his present mood was to take place. Not that
there could be any argument, but he knew the signs of
warfare when he saw them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there&#8217;s nothing else to do,&#8221; he replied, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing else to do! Do you mean to say they&#8217;re not
giving you a leave of absence?&#8221;</p>

<p>Black shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not asked for any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they know you&#8217;re going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know I&#8217;m likely to go. It was only fair to tell them
that to give them a chance to look around for a successor.
I&#8217;ve been perfectly frank with Mr. Lockhart about it.
He&#8217;s been skeptical all along as to my getting the call for
a good while yet, but I&#8217;ve warned him over and over that
it might come&mdash;just as it has come. So&mdash;I&#8217;m resigning
in the morning, and getting off at night. Good way to
go&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>&#8220;Good way for you&mdash;and a blamed poor way for some of
the rest of us. See here! Oh, hang that church&mdash;what&#8217;s
the matter with it? Why, my wife didn&#8217;t know this.
She supposes, of course, you&#8217;re going on leave. She thinks,
as I did, that the parish has got a string on you that
amounts to a rope, to haul you back with. Do you mean
to say&mdash;&mdash; Why, confound Sam Lockhart! I thought he
was one of your best friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; admitted Red, &#8220;you haven&#8217;t been particularly
easy to get along with. You preached war when
they wanted you to breathe peace, ever since you came.
You&#8217;ve insisted on picturing the flowing blood over there
when it made some of &#8217;em feel ill just to hear about it.
You&#8217;ve had your way about a lot of things, Bob, that they
were accustomed to manage their way. I suspect you&#8217;ve
been a thorn in some folks&#8217; flesh&mdash;bless your dogged spirit!
But&mdash;my faith!&#8221;&mdash;and his eyes shot fire&mdash;&#8220;to let you
cut loose and go to war, without&mdash;&mdash; Why, they ought to
be proud to <i>send</i> you. They ought to take you to the
station with a brass band. They ought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see here!&#8221; Black slid off the desk-edge, came over
to his friend, and caught him by both shoulders. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t make people over by roaring at them in my study.
And much as I want to see you, and warm as you make
the cockles of my heart by your roars, I&#8217;ve got to put you
out and get down to work. Why, man, do you realize
this changes all my plans for to-morrow in an instant?
I can&#8217;t preach the thing I meant to preach&mdash;not now.
I&#8217;ve had just one text in mind for my last Sunday here,
whenever it should be, and I&#8217;ve got to preach on that if
I stay up all night to think it out. And since it&#8217;s
already&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Red pulled out his watch. &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s ten o&#8217;clock this
minute. All right&mdash;I&#8217;ll get out. But first&mdash;lad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. The flow of his words, which had been well
started for a torrent, halted, ceased. He cleared his
throat. He took his lower lip between his teeth and bit
it savagely, then released it, waited a minute longer, and
spoke. But&mdash;could this be Red speaking?</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob,&#8221; he said, &#8220;before you go&mdash;will you take me into
your church?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence, because Black&#8217;s heart
simply stopped&mdash;turned over&mdash;and then went on again;
and an interval of experience like that always makes
speech impossible. And when he did speak all he could
say was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Red!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Now, I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Black&#8217;s hand seized his. The two hands gripped till
they practically stopped the circulation in both.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get consent to have a special communion service
in the morning&mdash;I should have wanted it anyway. You
know, of course, you&#8217;ll have to come before&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Red nodded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like that part. You&#8217;re the
only man I want to come before&mdash;but I&#8217;ll go through the
usual procedure. I may not measure up to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will. You&#8217;ve always measured up, only
you wouldn&#8217;t admit it. Don&#8217;t mind about that&mdash;just
answer the questions in your own way. See here, Red&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But he couldn&#8217;t say it, and Red knew that he couldn&#8217;t&mdash;and
didn&#8217;t want him to. Didn&#8217;t Red know without being
told that if there was one thing that could take the soreness
out of Black&#8217;s heart over having his church let him
go like this, it would be his receiving this other great desire
of his heart? How did Red know that Black wanted him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
in his church? Why, they had become friends! There
need be no other explanation.</p>

<p>So then Red went away. Where he went doesn&#8217;t
matter, just now, though wherever it was he went straight
as an arrow to it&mdash;rather, he went straight as one of those
famous seventy-five millimetre shells of the Great War
went to its objective. And when he hit the spot something
blew up and things were never the same again in
that particular place, quite as he had intended they
shouldn&#8217;t be. For a new member of the Stone Church&mdash;which
he wasn&#8217;t&mdash;yet&mdash;his activities seemed to begin
rather early.</p>

<p>Black sat down to his new sermon. No, he walked the
floor with it. He had said there was just one text he
wanted for that sermon, and given that text, plus the
tremendous stimulus of the complete change in the situation,
he could hardly stand up under the rush of his
thoughts about it. Instead of ploughing heavily, as he
had been doing, his mind was now working with lightning
rapidity. There was no time to write the new sermon
out, he could only frame its outlines and stop at his desk,
every now and then, to make notes of the filling in. By
midnight it was complete&mdash;the last sermon he was to
preach in this church; it might easily be the last he would
ever preach in any church. That didn&#8217;t matter; all that
mattered was that he should get his white-hot belief upon
the cold anvil of his audience&#8217;s intelligence and there hammer
it into shape till the anvil was as hot as metal, and
something had taken form that had never had form before.</p>

<p>It was two o&#8217;clock when he finally went to bed. It was
four o&#8217;clock when he went to sleep, six when he awoke.
When his eyes opened he had a new thing on his mind&mdash;and
it was an old thing&mdash;a thing he had long meant to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
and had never done. Strange that it should rise up to
bother him now when the day was already so full! He
tried to put it aside. He was sorry, but it was too late,
now. A pity that he hadn&#8217;t seen to it long ago, but it was
certainly too late now.</p>

<p>Was it too late? And why was the thought of it knocking
so persistently at the door of his plans for the day if it
were not that it was for him to do, after all? Somehow
he couldn&#8217;t put it aside&mdash;the remembrance of that forlorn
and neglected community, up on the hills, so near and yet
so far, where he had buried Sadie Dunstan, and to which
he had always meant to return&mdash;some day. And that
day had never come. Well, he had been incessantly busy&mdash;he
could have done no more. Demands upon his time
and strength had called him in every direction but&mdash;that.
Yet probably he had been no more needed anywhere than
there. Too bad, but it was most certainly too late
now.</p>

<p>At seven his telephone rang. It was Red&#8217;s voice which
hailed him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I just want to put myself at your disposal for the day
as far as I can cut my work to do it. Jim Macauley says
if you want his seven-passenger for any purpose whatever
consider him yours to command. He thought you might
want to pay some farewell visits or something, and would
like to take a few people along. Plenty of candidates
for the job&mdash;you&#8217;ll have to pick and choose. What time
do I&mdash;face the music?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just before church, Red&mdash;ten o&#8217;clock in the vestry
room. I&#8217;ve called them all&mdash;they don&#8217;t know whom it is
they&#8217;re to meet. About the car&mdash;thank you and Macauley.
I want very much to go up on the hills, where Sue Dunstan
came from, and hold a little open-air service this afternoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
I&#8217;m going to ask two of my boys to run up there and get
as many people notified as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great C&aelig;sar! That the way you&#8217;re going to spend
your last hours? Why, Ellen is planning to open our
house for all your friends and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank her heartily for me, will you? And tell her
that if she and you will go along with me up there I&#8217;ll like
it much better than anything else she can do for me. I
want to take Miss Ray, too, if I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything you say goes, of course. I told my wife I
doubted if you&#8217;d stand for the reception idea, and I don&#8217;t
blame you for not wanting it, but&mdash;I didn&#8217;t expect you&#8217;d
want to do a stunt like that. All right&mdash;I&#8217;ll stand by.
Sure you don&#8217;t want to preach to the crowd that&#8217;ll be at
the station? Wonderful opportunity&mdash;better not miss it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See you at ten o&#8217;clock, Red. Stop joking about this
day of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not joking&mdash;I&#8217;m just whistling to keep my courage
up. If you think this day is anything but deadly serious
to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is. Good-bye&mdash;Best Friend!&#8221; And Black
hung up the receiver on those last words which he would
hardly yet have ventured to speak if the two men had been
face to face. But his heart was warm with a great love
for Red this day&mdash;and a great reverent exultation over
what was soon to happen. Why not speak the words that
soon, call he ever so loudly, could not be heard, except
by the hearing of the spirit?</p>

<p>He rushed through his breakfast&mdash;it was a banquet, if he
had known it, prepared by devoted hands&mdash;and all but
ran through the early morning streets to the dismantled
shop and home on the little side street. Sue admitted
him, and took him through to the rear garden where Jane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
in working dress, was packing a box. She stood up, and
the colour rushed into her face at sight of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my call&mdash;I go to-night. I&#8217;m the lucky one to
go first and leave you behind. But I&#8217;m sorry about that,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pulled off the gloves which had protected her hands,
unfastened her apron, gave both to Sue, and sent her inside
with them. Then she faced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow I knew it was close at hand,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;To-night! Well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This afternoon will you go with Doctor and Mrs. Burns
and me&mdash;and Sue&mdash;I should like to take Sue&mdash;up to the
hills where the Dunstans lived? I want to say a few things
to those people up there before I go. I always meant to do
it, and never seemed to get around to it. Somehow I
can&#8217;t go away without doing it. And I want you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll go. I&mdash;yes, I&#8217;ll go&mdash;of
course. Oh, how glad you are to be off&mdash;and how I envy
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you coming to church this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him and away again. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
I&mdash;can,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He was silent for a minute, studying her. In the bright
light of the Sabbath morning, there in the garden, she had
never seemed to him a more perfect thing. Every little
chestnut hair that grew away from her brow, curving upward
in an exquisite sweep from her small ear, stood out
in that light; the texture and colour of her cheek, the poise
of her head upon her white, strong neck&mdash;somehow he
couldn&#8217;t help noting these lovely details as he had almost
never noted them before. It was as if he saw her through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
eyes sharpened already by absence and loneliness. He
tried to fix the image of her upon the tablet of his mind&mdash;just
the sheer physical image of her, as he might have put
away a photograph in his pocket, to carry with him. Yet
it was something far more subtle than that that he was
trying to fix&mdash;her whole personality, body and mind and
spirit&mdash;this was what he found himself wanting to take
with him in a way that he could never let go, no matter
how far away from her he might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t think you can,&#8221; he said at last,
gently. &#8220;Do you know that I never even asked it of you
before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you ask it now? You only said&mdash;&#8216;are you
coming?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t that tell the story? I don&#8217;t see how I can
quite&mdash;bear it&mdash;if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;I will. But I shall sit very far back, and you
may not even see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see you&mdash;if you are there at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had to hurry away then. There was no time to lose
if he would do half the things that must be done that day.
But long afterward in dark and dreadful scenes, the very
antitheses of this one, he could close his eyes and see the
little old garden, with its rows of pink and white and deep
rose hollyhocks against the vine-covered wall, and see Jane
standing in the bright sunlight. He must always remember,
too, what it cost him to stand there beside her, and
watch her, and know that, as with everything he looked
upon that day, it might be for the last time. It had taken
every particle of will he had to leave her. Fortunate for
him that that will had had a long schooling in doing what
it must, not what it would!</p>

<p>Ten o&#8217;clock&mdash;and Red at the vestry door. Within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
that door a strange Red, grave and quiet, facing a circle
of surprised and deeply interested men, wondering within
themselves how it had ever come about. A dignified
candidate was this, who answered questions, as Black
had bidden him, in his own abrupt and original way, and
more than once startled his questioners not a little. It
was at least three times that Black had to use all the tact
and discretion at his disposal to prevent a clash of arms
when it came to some technicality which to some man&#8217;s
mind was an important one. But in the end they were
satisfied. Not one of them but knew that if Dr. Redfield
Pepper Burns had come to the point where he was willing
to call the old Stone Church his own, it could only be because
some deep antagonism had given way&mdash;and that,
of itself, was enough to commend him to them. Such a
power as Red was in the whole community, he could be in
the church, if he would. And now that he would, they
must let him in, if they were not fools. And fools they
were not&mdash;and some of them were of those whose knowledge
is not wholly of earth, because it has been taught of
heaven. So they accepted Red, as well they might, though
he was as far from being a saint as any one of themselves,
nor ever would be one, while he remained below the stars.
The Church Militant is no place for saints, only for
human beings who would keep one another company on
a difficult road&mdash;and the company of One who went before
and knows all the hardships&mdash;and the glories&mdash;of the way.</p>

<p>Eleven o&#8217;clock, and Black in his pulpit. He faced a congregation
which filled every nook and cranny of the large
audience room, and stretched away into the distance in
rooms beyond opened for the emergency. News travels
fast, and this news had gone like lightning about the town,
for a very good reason. Black had summoned only two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
of his young men, despatching them to the hills to go from
house to house there. But these two, before they went,
had done a little despatching on their own initiative, with
the result to be expected. It was a great hour, and too
great honour could not be done.</p>

<p>As he rose to speak Black&#8217;s heart was very full. Jane
was there&mdash;he knew, because he had deliberately watched
both doors until he had seen her come in. And she was
not far away in a back seat, as she had said she would be.
Instead, she had permitted an eager young usher, in search
of a place in the already full church, to lead her away down
to the very front, though at one side and almost behind a
tall pillar. He had seen her slip into this pew, evidently
asking to change places with a child who had the pillar
seat, one well screened from the rest of the congregation.
Once Black had seen her safely in this place, so near him,
he breathed more deeply. He could forget everything
now, except this, his last chance, with that molten metal
he had been making ready for this hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And He, bearing His cross, went forth into a place called
the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>What happens, in the hour when a man gives himself
to a task like this; when all that he is, or ever hopes to be,
he lays upon the altar of his purpose? Human he may be,
and weak, utterly inadequate, as far as his own power
goes, to do the thing he longs to do. And yet&mdash;well,
many a man knows what it is to feel his spirit suddenly
strengthen with the hour of need, to feel pour into it something
intangible yet absolutely real and definite&mdash;and
Divine&mdash;to know himself able to take the minds and
hearts and wills of men into his two human hands and
mould them in spite of themselves. And this, as he had
hoped and prayed upon his knees, was what happened to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
Robert Black this last morning of his ministry to these
people. He could not have asked for a greater gift&mdash;no,
not if by putting out his hand he could have taken Jane&#8217;s
hand and led her away with him. For that hour, at least,
as he had wished, the man was lost in the priest; he was
consecrated, heart and soul, to his task. How should
those before him resist him&mdash;the messenger who spoke
to them with the tongue of inspiration? For so he spoke.</p>

<p>Christ upon the battle-field&mdash;that was his theme. Of
itself it was a moving theme; as he made use of it it became
a glorious one. Those who listened seemed almost to see
a manly, compassionate Figure moving among His young
soldiers, living in the trenches with them, facing the fight
with them, enduring the long night with them, lifting their
hearts, speaking to their spirits&mdash;inhabiting the place of
the skull as they inhabited it&mdash;and when the bullet or the
bit of shrapnel had gone home, saying &#8220;<i>I am with you, be
not afraid.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Who shall describe the preaching of a great sermon?
The pen has not been made which may do more than sketch
the various outlines of either experience&mdash;that of preacher
or that of listener, when God thus speaks to human hearts
through human lips. Reporter&#8217;s flying pencil may take
down the burning words themselves without an error;
only the shadow of the mountain falls upon the plane of
his notebook. Preacher may only say: &#8220;He spoke
through me to-day&mdash;somehow I know it&#8221;; listener may
only think: &#8220;I heard what I never heard before, or may
again.&#8221; Only He who inspired the message may know
all that it was or half that it accomplished. So it has
always been, and so it will ever be&mdash;on earth.</p>

<p>The sermon ended; the communion service began.
None went away, as ordinarily some were accustomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
do; it was if a spell had been cast upon the audience, it
remained so motionless. Only when, at the very first,
a tall figure with a flaming red head came forward at the
beckoning of Black, did other heads crane themselves
to see. The impossible had happened&mdash;no doubt of that.
It couldn&#8217;t be; but yes, it <i>was</i> Doctor Burns who was marching
down the aisle, to stand facing Black beside the Table
on which were set forth the Bread and Wine.</p>

<small>NO OTHER WAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>&#8220;YOU!</i>&#8221; It was Jane Ray&#8217;s astonished, all but shuddering
thought. &#8220;<i>You!</i>&mdash;and not&mdash;<i>me!</i> Oh, how
can it be? You, who I thought would stay outside with
me&mdash;and the like of me&mdash;forever, before you would bind
yourself like this. Do <i>you</i> believe the things that he does?
<i>You</i> could never be a hypocrite, Redfield Burns. Are
you doing it for love of Robert Black? No, you wouldn&#8217;t
do it, even for that, any more than I would. Then&mdash;what
<i>is</i> it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat with a white face and watching eyes which
burned darkly beneath her close-drawn, sheltering hat-brim,
while Red took upon himself the vows which Black
administered. When it was done, and Red stood straight
and tall again, and Black looked into his eyes and took
his hand, and said the few grave and happy words of
welcome which end such a service, Jane&#8217;s heart stood still
with pain and love&mdash;and envy. It seemed to her that
she must get away from the place somehow&mdash;anyhow&mdash;she
could endure no more.</p>

<p>But there was no getting away yet. She had to see it
through. And what came next was what Black had told
Mrs. Hodder was to come. All through the service, far
back in her usual place, the gray-haired housekeeper of
the manse had sat, still trembling a little now and then,
waiting to hear the blow fall. She it was who knew, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
said to herself, the dreadful thing which was coming.
Nobody else, she thought, knew that the minister meant
to resign his charge. She didn&#8217;t see why he must resign
it, why he shouldn&#8217;t come back. He had been here less
than a year and a half; he was in the full tide of his success;
the big church was his as long as he should choose to
keep it. She wondered how they would take it when they
knew. As for herself, her heart was very heavy. Who
was there, in all the church, who would miss him as she
would?</p>

<p>He was speaking. She moved her head and managed
to see him through the close-ranged congregation. He had
not gone back to the pulpit, he still stood beside the communion
table, on the floor below, so it was difficult to get
a view of him. He looked very manly and fine, she
thought; his face was full of colour, as it always was when
he had been preaching, and his black eyes were keen and
clear as he looked his people in the face and told them
that he was taking leave of them for good. He used few
words, and what he said was very simple and direct. He
had seen it his duty&mdash;and his great, great privilege&mdash;to
go over to France, and try to do his part. He had
preached what he believed with all his heart, and now
the time had come to prove that he believed what he had
preached. He said good-bye, and God bless them, and
wouldn&#8217;t their prayers go with him that he might be of
all the service to the men of his regiment that he could
know or learn how to be?</p>

<p>He was withdrawing, that they might act upon his resignation
according to custom, and he had all but reached
the narrow door beside the pulpit when an impressive
figure, that of Mr. Samuel Lockhart, in his well-fitting
frock coat of formal wear, rose in his pew. He motioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
to Mr. William Jennings, who sat near this door, and
Jennings took a few steps after the departing minister
and laid a hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go just yet,&#8221; Jennings warned him, in an excited
undertone.</p>

<p>Black turned. Mr. Lockhart spoke his name, and he
turned still farther and looked back at his chief officer.
Why in the world wasn&#8217;t he allowed to take himself away
at this juncture? Must he be detained to hear a conventional
farewell, a speech expressing hope that he would
come through unscathed, and thanks for what he had done
for the church in the short time that he had been with
them? There wasn&#8217;t much run-away blood in Black&#8217;s
make-up, but he was certainly wishing at that instant that
they hadn&#8217;t thought it necessary to hold him up, and that
he had taken those steps toward the door fast enough to
get through it and close it behind him before he could be
stopped. And then for the hillside and his open-air talk.
<i>That</i> was what he wanted most&mdash;and next! It seemed
to him he couldn&#8217;t breathe any longer, here with the
flowers and the people and the organ music and the stained-glass
windows! It was his church no longer....
Suddenly he knew that his heart was even sorer than he
had thought it was.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to do but face it. So he did
turn about, and came forward a few steps, and stood waiting.
They were all looking at him&mdash;all those people&mdash;and
some of them&mdash;why, yes, he could see spots of white
all over the church, which grew momently thicker. Could
it be that so many people as that were&mdash;crying? That
sore heart of his gave a queer little jump in his breast.
Why, then&mdash;they cared&mdash;or some of them cared&mdash;because
he wasn&#8217;t coming back!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;Mr. Black&#8221;&mdash;Samuel Lockhart cleared his throat&mdash;&#8220;we
have something to say to you before you go. We
want you to know that we deeply appreciate all that you
have done for this church in the short time you have been
with us&#8221;&mdash;(yes, Black had known that was what he would
say)&mdash;&#8220;and that though some of us have not always agreed
with you in your views on certain points, we have been
unable not to respect you. You yourself can testify that
we have listened to you, as we have listened to-day, with
close attention, always&mdash;you have compelled it. But
to-day we have listened with a new respect, not to say a
deep admiration for you.&#8221; (Black braced himself.
His eyes were fixed steadily upon those of his chief officer.
He told himself that it would be over sometime, and then
he could get away.) &#8220;And we have listened with something
else&mdash;with a sense of possession such as we have
never had before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lockhart cleared his throat again. Evidently
this speech was tough on him, too. What in the world did
the man mean? A sense of possession&mdash;of what?</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, we are not merely saying good-bye to you,
Mr. Black. That of itself would be enough to make this
occasion one long to be remembered. In fact, we are not
saying good-bye at all, we are saying &#8216;Till we meet again!&#8217;
For&mdash;if you will have it so&mdash;though you are leaving us for
the time being, you are going over to do what you consider
your part in the war&mdash;<i>as our representative</i>. The Stone
Church refuses your resignation, sir. Instead, it grants
you a year&#8217;s leave of absence which it will extend if you
ask it at the end of that period. And it says to you: Godspeed
to <i>Our Minister</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stir, a murmur throughout the big audience.
Handkerchiefs were held suspended in mid-air while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
everybody tried his or her best to see the face of Robert
Black. In his pew Redfield Pepper Burns had grown
redder and redder, till his face rivalled his hair in vividness.
Behind her pillar Jane Ray had grown whiter and whiter,
as she tried to stifle her pounding heart. At the back of
the church young Perkins, usher, all but gave out an
ecstatic whoop, and pinched the arm of a neighbouring
usher till it was an inflamed red, the victim only grinning
back joyfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely know,&#8221; said Robert Black, when he could
command his voice, which it took him a full minute to do&mdash;&#8220;that
a man must go with a braver heart in him if he goes&mdash;for
others, than if he goes by himself. I thank you&mdash;and
I accept the commission. God help me to be worthy
of your trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course he couldn&#8217;t get off till he had had his hand
wrung by several hundred people, during which process,
as he had expected, Jane slipped away. They wept over
him, they smiled tearfully at him, they all but clung to
him, but he could bear it now. If he suspected that it
was Red who had done this thing for him at the last&mdash;the
new member already beginning to make himself felt
with a vengeance!&mdash;it was impossible not to see that now
that it was done everybody was immensely glad and
satisfied over it. The hardest heads he had ever encountered
here were among those who were now proud to have
him go from the old Stone Church, the first chaplain in all
that part of the country to offer himself from the ministry.
Oh, yes&mdash;no doubt but it was all right now, and Black
would have been a man of iron if that sore heart of his
had not been somewhat comforted.</p>

<p>He had dinner alone with Mrs. Hodder, refusing a score
of invitations that he might give her this happiness. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
had been up, baking and brewing, since daybreak, and
he had divined that it would be a blow to her if he brought
even one guest home. He was glad, moreover, of the hour&#8217;s
interval in which to draw breath. He did his best to make
the eating of the sumptuous meal a little festival for the
woman opposite him, but in spite of his best efforts it
partook of the character of the parting bread-breaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you won&#8217;t be getting into danger so much, Mr.
Black, will you, as if you was a regular soldier?&#8221; Mrs.
Hodder suggested timidly, as the dinner drew to a finish
with not more than half the food she had prepared consumed.
It was the first time her thrifty nature had ever
thus let itself go, and she had looked conscience-stricken
ever since she realized the situation. But her question
voiced the thought uppermost in her mind. It took
precedence even of her worry about the terrible waste
of which she had been guilty!</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not to be anxious over any danger for me,&#8221;
Black assured her, smiling across the table at her. &#8220;Just
remember that some day you&#8217;ll get up another just such
splendid dinner as this for me, and then we&#8217;ll eat it with
better appetites. I shall come back ravenous for home
cooking, as all soldiers do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;you&#8217;ll keep the place open for me, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll keep it open for me, Mrs. Hodder. It&#8217;s you
who will be in demand for other positions. I&#8217;ll think myself
lucky if you promise to come back to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was glad to get away now from her tearful face, for
this assurance upset her completely, and she could only
apologize and weep again into a large handkerchief already
damp from the demands made upon it at the morning
service.</p>

<p>Red and the big Macauley car were at the door now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
with Mrs. Burns, Jane Ray, and little Sue Dunstan already
established in it. They were off and away at once.
Black sat beside Red, and the two fell into talk while
those behind silently watched them. They were an interesting
pair to watch, in conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are so different, one would hardly have expected
them to become such devoted friends,&#8221; Mrs. Burns said
to Jane, after a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you think they are so different?&#8221; Jane glanced
from the black head to the red one&mdash;they were not far
apart. Black&#8217;s arm was stretched along the back of
the seat behind Red; he was leaning close and talking
rapidly in Red&#8217;s ear. The latter was listening intently;
from time to time he nodded emphatically, and now and
then he interjected a vigorous exclamation of assent.
Evidently, whatever the subject under consideration,
they were remarkably agreed upon it&mdash;which had by no
means always been the case in past discussions. Perhaps
they were agreeing to agree to-day, since it was the last&mdash;for
so long.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to me much alike,&#8221; Jane went on, at Mrs.
Burns&#8217; look of inquiry. &#8220;Not in personality, of course,
but&mdash;well&mdash;in force of character, and in the way they both
go straight at a thing and never let go of it till they have
accomplished what they set out to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true; it may be the secret of the sympathy
between them. For a long time I thought they would
never get together, but it&#8217;s been coming, and now&mdash;and
to-day&mdash;&mdash; This has been such a wonderful day, in spite
of the sadness of it! You were at morning service?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mrs. Burns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of us will ever forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>The big car had them up in the hills in short order. As
they came over the last steep rise Red whistled sharply
with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;My faith!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;Where do they all come
from, in this God-forsaken region!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God hasn&#8217;t forsaken it. That&#8217;s a man-made phrase.
But they can&#8217;t all come from this locality. I should say
not&mdash;and they haven&#8217;t.... Why, there are my boys&mdash;any
number of them. Well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Black leaped out of the car, which had been instantly
surrounded. Here they certainly were, ranks upon ranks
of boys and young men, not only from his church but from
the town outside. Everyone of them wore a tiny American
flag on his coat-lapel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; explained young Perkins, lively usher at the
Stone Church, &#8220;we didn&#8217;t see how we could spare you to
come off up here this last day unless we came along.
Please excuse us for butting in, but we couldn&#8217;t stand it
any other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We mean it as a sort of guard of honour,&#8221; declared a tall
boy, just out of short trousers, and extraordinarily disputatious
for his age, with whom Black had held many a
warm argument in past days. &#8220;Besides, we&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently something was on the tip of his tongue which
had to be suppressed, for he was hauled off by Perkins
in a hurry while others took his place. The young men
all seemed much excited, and Black had to bring them
to order lest they put the rest of his audience in the
background. There were plenty of men and women,
and even children present, who were obviously from the
hill region, and these were they whom he had come to
meet.</p>

<p>Under his direction Perkins shortly proved that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
talents as an usher could be exercised quite as well in the
open air as under the stately roof of the home church.
He soon had the assemblage massed on a side hill which he
had selected as a sort of amphitheatre where all could see
and hear the man who stood upon the flat and grassy
plateau below. From this point of vantage presently
Black spoke to them.</p>

<p>One of the reporters of the morning, at the edge of the
crowd, sat taking notes in the very shortest of shorthand.
He needed all his powers now, even more than he had
needed them in the morning, for Black spoke fast and
crisply, as a man speaks when he feels the time is short
and there is much to say. As the young reporter set down
his dots and dashes he was subconsciously exulting to
himself: &#8220;Gee, but I&#8217;m glad I got in on this! What a
bully story this&#8217;ll make!&#8221;</p>

<p>It did make a story, but it was one which like that of
the morning could never be fully written. The words
Robert Black spoke now were not words like those of the
morning. He was looking into faces whose aspect gripped
his very soul; it seemed to him that they had all the same
expression&mdash;one of exceeding hunger. Even his boys&mdash;though
he was not talking now to them&mdash;were watching
him as those watch who are being fed. There is no look
like that to inspire a man, to draw out his best and biggest,
and it drew Black&#8217;s now, beyond anything of which he had
before been capable. The day, the hour, the near approach
of his departure, that &#8220;last chance&#8221; conviction
which had spurred him all day&mdash;all these facts and forces
combined to make of this final, most informal service he
was to hold in his own country for many a day the richest
and most worthy of them all. If it were not so, then those&mdash;Black&#8217;s
nearest friends&mdash;who listened with greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
appreciation and best capacity for judgment, were mightily
deceived.</p>

<p>Red stood with folded arms at the very back of the
audience, his hazel eyes seldom leaving the figure of his
friend. What was in his heart none could have told. His
face was set like a ruddy cameo as Ellen his wife looked
up at it now and again. Beyond him Jane Ray stood beside
a great elm; she leaned a little against it, as if she
needed its support. It was a tremendous hour for her,
following, as it did, all the repressed emotion of the morning.
Her face had lost much of its usual warm colour,&mdash;her
fine lips tensed themselves firmly against possible
tremor. Could she live through the day, she asked herself
now and then&mdash;live through it and not cry out a recantation
of the old position of unbelief, not call to Heaven
to witness her acceptance of a new one, passionately believing&mdash;and
then run into the arms she knew must open
for her? But she was dumb. Even he would not trust
a change in her now, she was sure, though his eloquence
this day had been that to sway far harder hearts than hers.
No, she must let him go&mdash;there was no other way. She
had made her bed and heaped it high with distrust and
scorn, and she must lie on it. Even for him she could not
take up that bed and walk!</p>

<p>Black ceased speaking. The hush over the hillside,
for the full minute following, was that of the calm before
the storm. Then&mdash;the storm came. Black&#8217;s young men&mdash;twenty
of them from the Stone Church&mdash;and eleven
from the town, thirty-one in all&mdash;stirred, looked about at
one another, nodded one to another, came forward together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Black,&#8221; said young Perkins, simply enough&mdash;fortunately
he had not tongue nor taste for oratory&mdash;&#8220;some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
of us have decided not to let you go &#8216;over there&#8217;
alone. Of course we can&#8217;t go with you, though we&#8217;d like
to mighty well. But we can enlist&mdash;and that&#8217;s what
we&#8217;re doing&mdash;to-morrow morning. We thought you&#8217;d like
to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back up the hillside a smothered sound burst from
Red&#8217;s throat&mdash;a queer sound between a groan and a laugh.
If Black had heard it, he would have understood what it
meant, and his heart would have ached harder than ever
for his friend. His wife did understand, and she slipped
her hand into his, where he crushed it till it ached with
pain, and she did not withdraw it. Beside them Jane
Ray bit her lips until they all but drew the blood. Was
there no end, then, to the breaking tension of this incredible
day?</p>

<p>&#8220;I do like to know,&#8221; said Robert Black, his eyes fiery
with joy and sorrow and all the things a man may feel
when a group of young patriots offer their all, unknowing
half what it means, but understanding enough to make the
act enormously significant of forming character, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m proud and happy beyond words.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hulking young giant from the hills stumbled forward,
and spoke diffidently from the edge of the group:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; too,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Perkins whirled. &#8220;Bully for you!&#8221; he shouted, and
made a flying wedge of himself through the other fellows,
to shake the giant&#8217;s brawny hand.</p>

<p>There came a second hill boy, younger and slighter than
the first. &#8220;He&#8217;s my pardner,&#8221; he said, with an awkward
gesture toward the other. &#8220;I guess if he goes, that&#8217;ll
mean me too.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were four of these. Fathers and mothers rose
in protest. The first lad turned and faced them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;Looky here!&#8221; he called defiantly. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to let them city fellers do our fightin&#8217;, are we? Not on
your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>That settled it. They were not going to let anything
like that happen&mdash;not on those unhappy lives of theirs.</p>

<p>It was over. The car got away from the last clinging
young hand that would have detained it, and in the long
shadows of the late afternoon swung down the hills to the
plain below, and the big town, and the last hours of the
day. When at length it halted in Jane&#8217;s narrow street
beside her door, above which her little sign no longer hung,
Black, getting out with her and Sue, said a word in Red&#8217;s
ear. The other shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;You&#8217;ve mighty little time
to spare now, if you have a bit of a snack with us before
your train goes. And I vow we won&#8217;t let you off from
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be let off. Give me five minutes here,
and I&#8217;ll be with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will come back for you at train time, Miss Ray,&#8221;
said Mrs. Burns.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think best to ask her to supper with us?&#8221;
questioned Red, as the others disappeared into the now
empty shop.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked her and she refused. I knew she would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wonder. These blamed last stunts&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Red lapsed into a dark silence, his chin sunk upon his
broad chest.</p>

<p>Within the shop Black turned to Sue. &#8220;Go out in the
garden, and wait, will you, Sue?&#8221; he asked, with the smile
which the child would have obeyed no matter what request
had gone with it. Reluctantly she closed the shop door
behind her. In the dismantled, empty place, where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
had first met Jane nearly eighteen months before, Black
said what he had come in to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall write&mdash;and you will answer. We can&#8217;t do without
that, can we? And there&#8217;s no reason why we should.
Is that understood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for standing by me this day. I know it&#8217;s
been hard for you. I couldn&#8217;t help that&mdash;I had to have
you. You&#8217;re not sorry&mdash;you stayed by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane&mdash;there are a thousand things I want to say to
you, but they&#8217;ve all got to go unsaid&mdash;except one. Wherever
I am&mdash;wherever you are&mdash;it will be the same with
me. There&#8217;ll be no one else&mdash;there never can be, now.
I wanted you to know&mdash;if you didn&#8217;t know already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you a word to say to me&mdash;Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head, trying to smile. &#8220;What is there
to say? Except&mdash;good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could put words into your lips,&#8221; cried Robert
Black, under his breath. &#8220;I want to hear you say them
so. At least&mdash;Jane&mdash;I can&#8217;t go without&mdash;once more&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent. It was somehow as if her will were in
shackles, and held her so she could neither move nor
speak. When they had been together at the seashore it
had been she who had said the more, she who had forced
the issue. Now&mdash;she was like a dumb thing, suffering
without power to free herself. It seemed to her that her
heart must break if he did not take her in his arms, and
yet she could not show him that heart. The whole day
had seemed to build a barrier mountains high between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
them, which she could do nothing to lower. Her hands,
pressed close to her sides as she stood before him, made
themselves into fists, the nails pressing into the firm pink
palms until they all but cut the flesh.</p>

<p>Suddenly he reached down and seized the hands in his,
then looked at them in amazement, as he drew them up
to view, because they did not relax.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; he asked her quickly. &#8220;Are
you&mdash;as unhappy&mdash;as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes then, and let him see&mdash;what he could
not help seeing. It was as far beyond what she had let
him see on that other day as this day in their lives was
greater than that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Jane!&mdash;Oh, my dear!&#8221; He could only whisper
the words. &#8220;And I have&mdash;to leave you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Good-bye&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she said again, steadily.</p>

<p>He let go one of her hands, and with his strong fingers
made her loosen one gripped fist. Then&mdash;the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to see them like that,&#8221; he said, with a
queer, tortured smile. &#8220;I want&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And he lifted first
one palm and then the other to his lips, and then gently
closed the fingers again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t hold them so tight again&mdash;please!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have to remember
them&mdash;that way. Jane&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how to go!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must. Doctor Burns is waiting for you. Don&#8217;t
mind about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind about you!&#8221; It was a cry of pain.
&#8220;Why&mdash;you&#8217;re all I do mind about&mdash;now. I&#8217;ve done all
the things I had to do to-day&mdash;they&#8217;re all done&mdash;everything&#8217;s
done&mdash;but this. And this&mdash;why, this&mdash;is so much
the hardest thing of all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>How could he speak at all, she wondered, when she
could not? She did not realize that expression of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
sort or another was the breath of his life to-day. That
having poured himself out, all day, to others, he could
not cease from giving; that though to-morrow might bring
upon him a silence and an immobility as great as her own,
for to-day his lips must have speech; his spirit, action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane&mdash;you won&#8217;t deny me&mdash;I can&#8217;t go without it.
God knows our hearts&mdash;knows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He left his own heart on her lips then, in one bitter-sweet
moment of such spending as he had never known&mdash;or
she&mdash;and went away, leaving her alone there in the
deserted shop with the memory of his whispered, &#8220;God
bless you&mdash;my Jane!&#8221; She ran to the window, screening
herself from view as best she could, and saw him get into
the car, and saw the car leap away down the narrow street.</p>

<p>An hour later she was at the station. Black had not
been in the car when it had come for her; it was full of
other people&mdash;the Macauleys and the Chesters, Red&#8217;s
neighbours and among Black&#8217;s best friends. Mrs. Burns
explained that the minister&#8217;s new guard, the boys who were
to enlist to-morrow, had come for him in a body, and had
borne him away in the biggest car they had been able
to find.</p>

<p>At the station there was the expected crowd, only it
was a larger crowd than any of them could have anticipated.
It was evening now, and almost dark, and it was
beginning to rain. The station lights shone on banks of
lifted umbrella tops; the little flags in the young men&#8217;s
coats grew wet. People went about saying what a pity
it was that it had to rain. And if it hadn&#8217;t been Sunday
night there would have been a band. Jane found herself
very thankful that there was no band. And then, suddenly,
there was a band&mdash;a small one, playing &#8220;Onward,
Christian Soldiers,&#8221; and the crowd was singing with it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
Jane wondered, through her dumb pain, how Robert
Black was bearing that!</p>

<p>Red was out of the car and off in the crowd&mdash;no doubt
but he was with Black. He had been heard to express the
hope that the blamed train would be on time and cut the
agony short, but of course it wasn&#8217;t. It was only ten
minutes late, however, though to Jane those ten minutes,
marked by the clock on the car&#8217;s dash, were the longest
she had ever known. Then&mdash;there was the shrill whistle
in the distance she had been waiting for, coming at an
interval in the music, and she heard it plainly, and her
heart stopped beating.</p>

<p>Black and Red were at the door of the car&mdash;they had
had to push their way through the people. Black was
shaking hands with Mrs. Burns&mdash;with Mrs. Macauley&mdash;with
everybody. Then Jane felt her hand in his, and lifted
her eyes to meet his. The headlight from another car
shone full in his face; she saw it as if it looked at her from
very far away. But his eyes&mdash;yes, she could see his eyes&mdash;and
see how they were piercing hers, as if he would look
through to her very soul for that last time&mdash;oh, she was
sure it was for the last time!</p>

<p>He did not say a word to her&mdash;not a word. But his
hand, for that instant, spoke for him. Then he had gone
away again, through the crowd, for the train was in, and
the locals made but short stops. A shout went up&mdash;Black&#8217;s
young men waved their arms, their flags&mdash;their
umbrellas&mdash;everything they had.</p>

<p>He stood on the back platform, as he so often had stood
before, when the train pulled out. He looked back at
them, the crowds, the flags, the umbrella tops&mdash;but he saw
only one thing&mdash;the thin, gleaming rails, stretching away,
farther and farther into the distance&mdash;and the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>AT FOUR IN THE MORNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE morning papers! How many did Red have of
them?</p>

<p>Robert Black had been away for almost a year. Jane
Ray&#8217;s little shop had been so long closed that few now
turned down the narrow street, forgetting that the sign
no longer told where the rarest and most valuable things
in town surely could be found. People had ceased to ask
who was the tall young man with the interesting face who
was said to write the most brilliant articles to be found in
certain columns of one of the great dailies. Tom Lockhart
was gone, and Harry Perkins, and many another figure
from the suburban streets. Only an occasional youth
could be seen now and then upon a delivery wagon.
Girls were everywhere, taking the places of the young
men who had gone. Everything was changed&mdash;everything;
now that war had come so near that it could be
felt.</p>

<p>Those morning papers! Red bought and bought, not
satisfied with the morning and evening editions delivered
at his door. He came home with bundles of them under
his arm, and scanned them hurriedly, his face darkening
as he read. For the news was heavy news, of losses and
reversals, of a gathering tide which could not be stemmed,
of worn and wasted French and British regiments falling
slowly but surely back because it was not possible to hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
another hour against the tremendous odds of reinforced
enemy lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will we get in? Great God, those fellows can&#8217;t
hold out forever!&#8221; Red would shout, dashing the latest
paper to the floor where its black and ominous headlines
seemed to stare back at him with the inescapable truth
in each sinister word. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get into it too late&mdash;they
can&#8217;t stand such awful pressure. Oh, if we&#8217;d been ready!&mdash;instead
of sleeping on our arms. Arms&mdash;we hadn&#8217;t
any&mdash;though they kept telling us&mdash;the men who knew.
We thought we were fine and fit&mdash;we&mdash;fat and heavy with
easy lives. Yes, we&#8217;re awake now but we&#8217;ve a long
way yet to run to get to the fire, and meanwhile, the
world is burning up!&#8221;</p>

<p>So he would rage, up and down the long living room
in his own home, unable to find a ray of light in the whole
dark situation. Even more poignant than these were his
anxieties of a personal sort. Where&mdash;when he stopped
to think about it&mdash;was Robert Black, that he hadn&#8217;t been
heard from now for many weeks? Black had gone across
with one of the first divisions, one made up of men many
of whom had had former army training, men fit to fight
at once, who had gone away believing that they would soon
see active service. By great good fortune&mdash;or so Black
had esteemed it&mdash;he had been sent for at the last minute
to take the place of an old regimental chaplain who had
fallen seriously ill. The substitute&#8217;s early and persistent
applications for a post had commended him as one who
meant to go anyhow, and so might as well be given the
opportunity first as last. That was the sort they had
wanted, for that was the sort they were themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bob&#8217;s last letter&#8217;s dated a good two months
back,&#8221; Red announced, one June morning of that second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
summer, scanning the well-worn sheets. How many
times had he read that letter, his wife wondered as she
saw him consulting its pages again. Black wrote remarkably
interesting letters. In spite of censorship he somehow
managed to get in all sorts of vivid paragraphs in which not
the sharpest eye could detect forbidden information&mdash;there
was none there. But there was not lacking keen
character drawing, graphic picturing of effect of sun and
shadow, stimulating reactions, amusing anecdote. Red
had never enjoyed any correspondence in his life as he
had that with the chaplain of the &mdash;&mdash;th regiment,
&mdash;&mdash;th division. And this was for many reasons, chief
of which was the great and ever-growing bond of friendship
between the two men, which separation just after
it had been made forever secure had only served incredibly
to strengthen and augment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it. I don&#8217;t like it. I wish I could
hear,&#8221; Red complained, replacing the thin sheets in the
now tattered flimsy envelope with the foreign postmarks
and the official stamps of various sorts which proclaimed
it a military missive. &#8220;He was writing fairly regularly
up to that date, but then he stopped short off, as if he
had been shot. Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean that&mdash;queer how
that old common phrase needs to be avoided now. It&#8217;s
none too improbable, either, in his case, if he ever gets
near the Front. He&#8217;ll be no rear-guard sort of chaplain&mdash;that&#8217;s
easy enough to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went off about his work, on this particular morning,
with a heavier heart than usual. He hadn&#8217;t counted up
before, just how many weeks it was since he had heard
from Black; he only knew that he had been scanning the
mails with a disappointed eye for a good while now.
Where could Black be&mdash;what had happened to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
his writing as before? Hang it!&mdash;Red wished he could
hear this very day. His mental vision called up clearly the
man&#8217;s handwriting on the foreign envelope; he always
liked the look of it so well. It was rather a small script,
but very clear, black, and full of character; the t&#8217;s were
invariably crossed with vigour, and there were only straight
forward marks, no curlycues. He wished he could see
that handwriting within the hour, wished it with a queer
certainty that he should most certainly not see it, either
to-day or to-morrow. Black was somewhere off the line
of communication, he grew surer and surer of it.</p>

<p>As the day advanced Red found his presentiment that
his friend was close to danger amounting to a conviction.
Red was not an imaginative person, and ordinarily he was
a persistent optimist; to-day it seemed to be impossible
to summon a particle of optimism concerning either the
duration of the war or the personal safety of the man he
cared for so deeply. He did care for him deeply&mdash;he no
longer evaded or made light of his affection for Robert
Black. What was the use? It was a fact accomplished;
nothing that happened or didn&#8217;t happen could now change
it; everything seemed to intensify it.</p>

<p>Close to eleven o&#8217;clock of the evening of this day Red
was returning from a call which had taken him out just
as he was beginning to think longingly of rest and sleep.
Passing a news-stand he had bought the latest evening
edition of the latest city daily sent out to the suburbs,
and had found in it only a deepening presage of coming
disaster to the armies of the Allies. This paper was sticking
out of his pocket as he walked wearily along the deserted
streets of the residence district, through a night
air still and heavy with the lingering heat of the day. He
took off his hat and mopped his forehead. Was it hot and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
still and heavy with languor and dread over there at this
hour, too, he wondered, up on that bending Western front?
Or were the shells bursting and the sky red and yellow with
the flares of the guns, and black with smoke and death?
Allowing for the difference in time it was almost four in the
morning over there. Wasn&#8217;t it about this hour that things
were apt to happen, over there, after a night of waiting?
Wasn&#8217;t this often the &#8220;Zero&#8221; hour&mdash;&#8220;over there&#8221;?</p>

<p>To reach his own home he would naturally go by the
manse, unless he went a little out of his way. It must be
confessed that Red had acquired the habit, since Black
left town, of going that little out of his way, when coming
home at night from this part of town, to avoid passing the
Stone Church and the deserted manse close by in its large
shadow. He didn&#8217;t know quite why he should have
yielded, at first unconsciously, afterward with full recognition
of his feeling about it, to the wish not to see the drawn
shades and darkened windows of his friend&#8217;s former habitation.
But on this evening, somehow, almost without
his own consent he found himself turning at that corner
to go by the house.</p>

<p>Dark? Yes, it was dark&mdash;almost darker than usual, it
seemed; though this was undoubtedly because the nearest
arc-light was burning more feebly than ordinarily to-night.
Anyhow, the place was enveloped in gloom. It
presented a very different aspect from that which had belonged
to it during the term of Black&#8217;s residence. His
study had been one of the big square rooms upon the
front, its windows always lighted in the evening, the
shades drawn only low enough to insure privacy, not to
prevent the warm glow of the study light from telling its
friendly tale of the occupant within, at home to all comers
at all hours, as he had been at pains to make understood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>Red didn&#8217;t like to look at those dark windows. Many
and many a time during the last months before Black&#8217;s
departure, after the friendship between the two men had
become a known quantity no longer negligible, the big
doctor had turned aside from the straight road home to
make a late call in that study, the light beckoning him
more and more irresistibly. Weary, or blue, or fuming
over some unlucky or harassing happening in his work,
he had gone stumbling or storming in, always to find a
hearty welcome, and such quiet understanding and comradeship
as soon eased the situation, whether he knew it
then or only afterward. Many a pipe had he smoked
while sitting in Black&#8217;s old red-cushioned rocker&mdash;to
which he had taken an odd fancy&mdash;and many a story had
he told, or listened to.... There could be no pipe-smoking
there to-night, nor telling of stories. The fire
upon that hearthstone was cold. God only knew when it
would be lighted again, or whose hand would light it.</p>

<p>Red turned in at the walk which led to the manse door.
He did not want to turn in, yet he could not go by. The
lawn before the house was shaven; it had to be kept up
because there was no dividing line between it and the close-cut
green turf which surrounded the Stone Church. Between
the vestry door and side door of the manse ran a
short walk, so that the minister had only a few steps to
take when he crossed the narrow space. Somehow Red
could almost see the tall, well-built figure striding across
that space, the strong face full of spirit....</p>

<p>He took a turn about the house, completely circling
it, telling himself that now he was here he might as well
see that all was as it should be from front to rear. Returning
to the front, he heard a distant clock in the centre
of the town booming out the slow strokes of the hour&mdash;eleven.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
Four o&#8217;clock it was then on that Western front,
three thousand miles away. Was Black there&mdash;or anywhere
near there? Wherever he was it might be that&mdash;well&mdash;was
there any reason why Red shouldn&#8217;t be able
to get him out of his mind? And was there any reason
why Red shouldn&#8217;t do what he was now suddenly impelled
to do? According to Black&#8217;s own code there was
every reason why he should do it&mdash;and none conceivable
against it. Sentimental superstition?&mdash;or great spiritual
forces at work of which he could know nothing, except
to feel their power?</p>

<p>He went over to the vestry door&mdash;a narrow door of
classic outline and black oak austerity, appearing in the
deep shadow like the entrance to the unknown. He leaned
his uplifted arm against it, and rested his bared head
against his arm. Somehow he felt nearer to his absent
friend in this spot than he had ever felt before.</p>

<p>&#8220;O God,&#8221; he implored, under his breath, &#8220;wherever he
is&mdash;take care of him. He&#8217;s worth a lot of taking care
of&mdash;and he won&#8217;t do it himself&mdash;somehow I know that.
Just do it for him&mdash;will You?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On this same night, at a Field Hospital, ten miles back
from the firing line on a certain sector of the French Front,
Jane Ray went about her duties. It was a comparatively
quiet night; no fresh casualties had come in for several
hours, and none was expected before morning.</p>

<p>Beginning as nurses&#8217; helper Jane had worked and studied
at all hours, had faced several examinations, and was now,
by virtue of the pressing demand and the changed requirements
which in war time hasten such matters, an
accredited nurse with a diploma. She had thought many
times gratefully of a certain red-headed surgeon back in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
the States, who had put her through many grilling tests
of his own since he had learned what she had in view.
Not once but often she had watched him operate; hours
on end had she listened to informal lectures from his lips,
delivered at the back of her shop when custom was slack.
It had all helped immensely in her work of preparation,
and in her dogged purpose to make herself fit for service
in the least possible time. And now she was at the very
goal of her desires, having for the last month been serving
as near the active Front as a nurse may get, the Field
Hospital to which the wounded are sent from the First-Aid
Station.</p>

<p>It had become to her an almost passionate joy to give
these poor fellows their first sense of real comfort. Though
the resources at hand were often far less than adequate
to the demand, when cases poured in till the hurriedly
arranged accommodations were full to overflowing and there
was no such thing as supplying every need, this was the
time when Jane most exulted in her work. Physically
strong, though she was often weary to exhaustion, a few
hours of sleep would put her on her feet again, and she
would go back to her task with a sense of being at last
where she was born to be. She managed somehow to
give to her patients the impression that no matter how
busy or hurried she might be she had something to spare
for each one of them, and this perhaps was one of the
greatest services she rendered. Skilful though her hands
and brain had become at ministering to the wants of the
wounded bodies, her heart had grown still wiser in its
knowledge of the larger needs of the tried spirits of those
who lay before her. Tender yet bracing was the atmosphere
which she carried everywhere with her. It is the
aura which to a greater or less degree surrounds every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
true nurse, and Jane, in acquiring it, had but learned the
rudiments of her profession. Yet perhaps she had rather
more than the ordinary capacity for divination of the
peculiar and individual necessities of the men under her
care, for certain it was that most of them preferred her
to any of the others, accomplished and devoted though
they all were. It is quite possible that the fact that she
was, as the boys put it among themselves, so &#8220;easy to
look at,&#8221; may have accounted for a portion of her popularity,
but surely not for all.</p>

<p>They did not stay long with her; it was a matter of but
a few days in most cases, before they were moved back
to the Evacuation Hospital, many miles in the rear. She
had not time to get to know any of them well; yet somehow
in even that brief interval of experience she and they
usually arrived at a feeling of acquaintance which often
became a memory not to be forgotten.</p>

<p>On this June night Jane found herself returning more
than once to a certain patient who had been brought in
early in the evening suffering from rather severe injuries.
The surgeons had decided against immediate operation;
he was to be retained here only long enough to recover
from shock, and to be got into shape for the journey back
to the Base. He was only a boy, or looked so, in spite of
the lines which pain had brought into his face. He was
not able to sleep, and for certain definite reasons he had
been given nothing to make him sleep. Each time Jane
came by she found him lying with eyes wide open; restless
of body his injuries did not permit him to be, for he was
strapped and bandaged into a well-nigh immovable position.
Clearly his mind was doing double duty, and being
restless for both.</p>

<p>As she stopped beside his cot again, he looked up at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
and spoke, for the first time. His eyes had followed her
all night, whenever she came in range, but she was used
to that. Eyes wakeful at night always follow a nurse;
she is a grateful vision to men long removed from the sight
of women; the very lines of the uniform are restful to
look at. The face beneath the veil-like head-dress need
not be a beautiful one to be attractive; it needs only to be
friendly and compassionate; if it can show a capacity
for humour, so much the better. In Jane&#8217;s case, actual
loveliness of feature drew the gaze of those tired young
eyes, many of which had seen only ugliness and horror
for a long, long time. The casualty cases thus far had
been confined almost entirely to the French and British,
with an occasional American enlisted in a foreign division.
It was only within the last few days that the men from
Jane&#8217;s own country had begun to come under her care,
showing that at last, as they had so longed to be, they
were &#8220;in.&#8221;</p>

<p>This boy, beside whom Jane paused in her rounds, and
who now spoke to her, had had from the first something
familiar about him. But she had not been able to place
him in her remembrance and had decided that it was only
the type she recognized, not the individual. Now, however,
as she bent to catch the low-spoken words, she realized
what had happened; here was a boy from home!</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know me, do you?&#8221; he said, with difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost thought I did, but wasn&#8217;t sure. Do you come
from my town and ought I to know you? You see&mdash;you
must have changed quite a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking intently into his face, and her reassuring
smile answered his wistful one.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t expect you to know me, but I&mdash;kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
hoped&mdash;you would. I know you. You was there when
I said I&#8217;d enlist&mdash;up on the hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her thoughts leaped back to that last Sunday of Robert
Black&#8217;s departure and to the service on the hillside. Her
face lighted with recognition, and the boy saw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;I do remember&mdash;of course I do. I sewed a
star on a service flag for you and the other three who went
from the hill, and took it up to the schoolhouse before I
went away. I think I know your name.&#8221; She racked her
memory hastily for it and found it, and the boy&#8217;s eyes were
suffused with joy as she spoke it. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you&mdash;Enos
Dyer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m Enie Dyer, only I don&#8217;t like to be called
that over here &#8216;cause it sounds like &#8216;Heinie.&#8217; Say,&#8221;&mdash;he
scanned her face anxiously,&mdash;&#8220;know anything &#8217;bout where
the preacher is now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Black? Nothing at all. It is weeks since I
had any news of him. His division has been sent up
toward the Front, and they may be in things by now; we
get only rumours here about what is happening on the
other sectors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew,&#8221; he said anxiously. &#8220;I get to thinkin&#8217;
&#8217;bout him a lot. He didn&#8217;t know me any, but I knew him
all right. After that time he buried the Dunstan girl
I used to come down to his church. I liked to hear him
talk. But I always skun out the minute things was over,
so he never really did lay eyes on me till that last day.
I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose he&#8217;d remember me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane would have liked to let him say more, to have
questioned him closely, herself eager to hear the least
mention of the name which was always in the background
of her thoughts. But she knew that he must not be allowed
to use his feeble powers in this way. So after assuring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
him that Black was not the man to forget the four
boys from the hill who had enlisted on that memorable
day, she went on upon her rounds, her own mind filled with
the vivid recollections young Dyer&#8217;s words had called up.</p>

<p>But she could not come near him on this night without
his eyes imploring her to give him another word. So
she learned that he was most unhappy lest the injuries
he had received prevent his return to the Front, and was
worrying badly about it. She became presently so interested
in his state of mind that she called the attention
of one of the surgeons to him. Doctor Mills read
the record upon his cot-tag, looked at Dyer keenly through
his big horn spectacles, and smiled, his own tired, thin
face relaxing its tense look of care.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get back, my lad,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when they&#8217;ve
fixed you up. With that spirit you&#8217;ll get anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Enos Dyer&#8217;s lips trembled. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, then,&#8221; he
murmured, with a sigh of relief. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done nothin&#8217;
yet, an&#8217; I figger to, &#8217;fore I get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing when you got these?&#8221; The
surgeon indicated Dyer&#8217;s bandaged shoulder and his
slung leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just tryin&#8217; a little job o&#8217; my own, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not under orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I was under orders, sir&mdash;but the gettin&#8217;
through was sort o&#8217; up to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. You&#8217;re a company runner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The surgeon went away. Jane did what she could to
induce sleep for Dyer, who needed it badly, but his eyes
were still wide when dawn drew near. By and by, as she
came to give him water, which he drank thirstily, he said
slowly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>&#8220;Did you hear the preacher the time he told about
that feller Daniel in &#8217;mongst the lions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think so, Enos.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just wonderin&#8217; if <i>he</i> was in &#8217;mongst &#8217;em now
anywheres. If he is, I guess he won&#8217;t get hurt. I&#8217;ve
thought about that story a lot since I heard him tellin&#8217;
it. I guess if God could take care of anybody when lions
was walkin&#8217; all &#8217;round him, He could do it when anybody
was fightin&#8217;, don&#8217;t you? And I guess the preacher&#8217;s
fightin&#8217;, wherever he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s lips smiled a little. &#8220;Chaplains don&#8217;t fight,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet <i>he</i> does,&#8221; Dyer insisted.</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t try to change his conviction, but somehow it
took hold of her; and presently, in a strange hush that fell
just before the dawn, when there came a cessation of sound
of the guns which usually were to be heard clearly at this
distance from the Front, she stood in a doorway that faced
the east and took a well-worn letter from her pocket. In
the faint light from within the ward her eyes once more
scanned lines she already knew by heart.</p>

<p>Letters from Black had reached her infrequently and
the latest was dated weeks ago. Of course he could give
her no details of his movements, neither past nor expected;
she understood also that he could say little of that which
was personal to himself and Jane. No man writes for the
scrutinizing eye of a censor that which he would say to
one alone. Yet somehow he had managed to convey a very
vivid sense of his presence, and of his constant thought
of her, in the midst of his work among his men. The
last paragraph, especially, was one to stay by her while
she should have a memory, reserved though the words
were:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>&#8220;I am very sure that in all this experience you are having
you must find the thing I so much want you to find.
How can you escape it? It is all around you. I can&#8217;t
get away from it a minute. You know what I mean. I
never felt it so strongly, nor so depended upon it. Every
hour it is in my thought of you. You are well up toward
the Front now, I suppose. At any time a bomb may be
dropped on your Hospital; it is always a shining mark for
the enemy. Yet I am not anxious about you. For this
I know:&mdash;whatever happens to you or me, it can do no
harm to the eternal thing which is ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>She read the words again and again. Well she knew
what they meant; in spite of the restraint in them they
were full to the brim with his feeling toward her. Where
was he now&mdash;near&mdash;or far? There had been a rumour
here that the division in which he served had been suddenly
rushed from its training trenches to the Front, in a
desperate attempt to stem the creeping enemy tide threatening
to become a deluge and wash away all defences.
There were many rumours; few could be trusted. But it
might easily be true; he might at this very hour be under
fire, even though he remained in the shelter of trench or
dugout. Would he stay in such shelter? The question had
never occurred to her in just this form before. Her ideas
of the duties of a regimental chaplain were all based on the
knowledge that he was a non-combatant, like Cary. She
had had far more fears for her brother, with his temperament,
full of recklessness and daring, than for Robert
Black. But now, though she scouted the idea of Black&#8217;s
actually fighting, she had a sudden vision of him in danger.
If he had gone with his men up to those front lines, where
was he to-night?</p>

<p>Suddenly the distant sky-line burst into flame before her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
eyes. She had seen it before, that sky-line, during the
months since she had come to the Field Hospital, but always
before it had been when she was too busy to stop to
look at it. Now, in the brief breathing space, she was at
leisure to study it in all its sinister significance, and to
listen to the distant thunder of the guns.</p>

<p>He might not be there&mdash;she was very sure he was not,
for the returning wounded brought fairly accurate reports
of what divisions were engaged in the fighting in this
sector. But somewhere&mdash;somewhere&mdash;on that long, bending
line, stretching over so many long miles, and now
grown so thin and in many places so dangerously weak
compared with the ever augmenting enemy forces&mdash;somewhere
there he might be. According to that persistent
rumour the American troops who had been rushed forward
were at a point less than twenty miles away. Whatever
happened, however, none of them would come through
this particular Field Hospital, and it might be very long
before she would know definitely how near Black had been
to actual danger.</p>

<p>She looked at her little service watch&mdash;it was just past
four. She must go back: it would not be long now before
the ambulances would be rushing in with the fresh wounded
sent back from that angry sky-line. The stretcher-bearers
would be setting their woeful burdens down before her,
and all she had to give must be theirs, for the hour.</p>

<p>For a moment she closed her eyes. She still held the
letter in her hand; she lifted it and laid her cheek against
it; then she pressed it to her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wherever you are,&#8221; she breathed, &#8220;I think you
need me. I think you are thinking of me. But whether
you are or not&mdash;I&#8217;m there.&mdash;Oh, Robert Black&mdash;<i>I&#8217;m
there</i>!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>In a narrow, winding, muddy ditch&mdash;which was all it
was, though it went by another name&mdash;with short, ladder-like
places for the ascent of its sides here and there, Robert
Black was waiting, with a detachment of his men, for a
certain hour, minute and second previously fixed by orders
received in the early evening. He was at a crisis in his
experience which he had known would come some day,
but it had been long delayed. Now it was at hand.
These men with whom he had been stationed, throughout
their voyage overseas, their foreign training, and their
slow and tedious progress toward the French Front, were
about to receive their first real test. At that fixed early
morning hour they were going for the first time &#8220;over
the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>By now Black knew most of them pretty well. In the
beginning they had received him cautiously, watching
him closely, as a man who comes to a regiment with a cross
on his collar is bound to be watched. They hadn&#8217;t particularly
liked their former chaplain, whose place Black
had taken at almost the last hour before they sailed. This
man had never been able to get very near to them, though
he had tried conscientiously and persistently to do so.
They weren&#8217;t exactly prejudiced against chaplains&mdash;they
supposed they were somehow necessary and unavoidable
adjuncts of military service&mdash;but they didn&#8217;t see so
very much use in having them at all. So when Black
came they had looked him over curiously and not without
a certain amount of prejudgment.</p>

<p>The voyage over had been a rough one; a large proportion
of the men had been seasick. Black, who had crossed
the Atlantic many times on those trips back home to see
his mother, was a first-rate sailor, and he had had his first
chance with his men during those long days of storm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
wet and dark discomfort. He had made the most of it,
though he had taken care not to overdo the effort to bring
cheer to those who if not seasick were mostly homesick,
whether they succeeded in concealing it or not. He had
gone about quietly but efficiently, and the impression he
had given had been that of one who had cast in his lot
with his regiment for better or for worse, though he wasn&#8217;t
making any fuss about it.</p>

<p>When they had reached the other side and gone into
camp, they soon discovered that the first impression they
had had of their chaplain held; that he meant to share
and share alike with them whatever fell to their lot.
Though he rated as captain and had therefore the right
to associate with the officers and to mess with them,
he didn&#8217;t seem to be spending much time at it. He
was very good friends with those in authority, who
seemed to like him; but he apparently cared more about
making friends with the private in the ranks than with
the Major, or the Colonel commanding. He was not a
joke-maker; he didn&#8217;t slap the boys on the shoulder nor
shout at them; but he carried about with him an atmosphere
of good cheer of a quiet sort. And when, now and
then, it came to a contest of wits, and somebody tried
to put the chaplain in a corner, he was sure to find his
way out with a quick and clever retort which brought the
laugh without making things too uncomfortable for the
cornerer&mdash;unless he deserved it, in which case he was
pretty sure to wish he hadn&#8217;t spoken.</p>

<p>As to preaching&mdash;they crowded to hear him, after the
first tentative experiment. The same unescapable logic,
the same clear and challenging appeal, the same unafraid
plain-speaking which had won Redfield Pepper Burns won
these men&mdash;who were only boys after all. When it came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
to the matter of preaching they were keen and merciless
critics. They didn&#8217;t want to be talked down to; they
didn&#8217;t like to be beguiled into listening with song and
dance; they wanted a man if he were going to speak to
them at all to do it without mincing, or setting traps for
their attention. They wanted him to look like a man and
act like a man&mdash;and unequivocally and all the time <i>be</i>
a man. In the nature of things, it wasn&#8217;t difficult for
Robert Black to fill this bill. A great many words have
been written in the effort to tell what soldiers want&mdash;if
they want anything at all&mdash;from their chaplain. They
are not hard to satisfy, critical though they are and pitiless,
when they detect failure to measure up to their requirements.
The greatest of these requirements is certainly
simple enough and just enough; it&#8217;s only what is required
of themselves, which is to be men and comrades, to the last
ditch.</p>

<p>It was not the last ditch, but the first one, to which they
had come this night. The trench was like other trenches,
but they had not been in a front-line trench before; somehow
it seemed different. The troops whose place they
had taken were worn and dog-weary, they had quitted
the place with evident satisfaction; they had held it five
days after they had expected to be relieved&mdash;it was a
mighty good place to get out of. And now, it was the new
arrivals&#8217; turn to face the music of the shells and the
machine-gun fire and the snipers&#8217; bullets&mdash;and all the
rest that was waiting for them. Their chance had come
at last.</p>

<p>Black had been ordered to stay in the rear, but he had
courteously disputed the order, had had it out with his
superior officer and had been told to go along. This,
he understood, was a mere matter of form, to try him out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
A chaplain had a perfect right to go where he would with
his men, provided he had the nerve. And why shouldn&#8217;t
Black have the nerve? He had been cultivating it for a
good many years now, and having been born in Scotland
he had started out with rather more than his share of it
in the beginning. Besides, are shot and shell the only
things to try what a man is made of?</p>

<p>The men in the trench liked having their chaplain with
them; there could be no doubt of that, though they by no
manner of means said so. They hadn&#8217;t been expecting
to have him accompany them to the very Front, and when
he came along as a matter of course they were glad of it.
His uniform by now was quite as mud-stained and worn
as theirs; the only difference was that they were expecting
to get bullet holes in theirs, while his, they considered,
with any sort of luck would be kept intact. Even so,
he was a good sport to stay by until the very last moment,
and they appreciated it. He was a comfortable sort to
have around. He wasn&#8217;t old enough to be the father of
any of them, but he was something like an older brother.
And there was one thing about him they very definitely
enjoyed, and that was his smile. It wasn&#8217;t a broad grin,
but it was a mighty nice one, and when any man had said
something that brought that pleasant laugh to Bob&#8217;s lips,
that man always felt decidedly warm and happy inside.
Because&mdash;well&mdash;the chaplain didn&#8217;t go around grinning
conscientiously at everybody all the while, and his smile
wasn&#8217;t the easiest thing in the world to win. Yes, the
secret is out&mdash;they called him &#8220;Bob&#8221; behind his back,
and they called him that because they liked him in that
capacity of elder brother. To his face they called him
&#8220;Parson.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was very still and dark in the trench; the raid was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
start with the opening of the barrage which would cover
the advance. Night&mdash;and darkness&mdash;and quiet&mdash;and
the hour before dawn at which the courage of the sons of
men is at its lowest&mdash;no wonder that hearts beat fast and
faces slackened colour beneath the tan, and the minutes at
once crawled and raced. They were unquestionably
nervous, these boys, hard as they tried to keep cool as
veterans. How would they acquit themselves?&mdash;that
was the thing that worried them. For the fact was that
in this particular company there was not one who had ever
seen actual warfare; they were all yet to be tried.</p>

<p>Black went from one to another, taking whispered
messages, hastily scrawled notes, which they gave to him,
and making clear his understanding of the various requests.
They all wanted to shake hands with him, seeming
to feel that this was the proper farewell to take of him
who was to stay behind. He wasn&#8217;t armed, though he
wore a helmet and gas mask, like themselves; his hands
were free to take their consignments, as his spirit was free
to put courage into them. Not that they realized that
he was doing it; all they knew was that somehow after
they had had a word with him, and felt that warm handshake
of his, they knew that they were stronger. He
believed in them&mdash;they understood that&mdash;and they meant
to measure up. That was about what his presence
amounted to, which was quite enough.</p>

<p>One boy, a slender fellow, not long out of hospital where
he had been sent for a run of an epidemic disease, came to
Black at almost the last moment with a diffident question.
&#8220;Parson,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;I want you to do something
for me. If I&mdash;if I should get scared out there&mdash;or anything&mdash;and
the boys should know about it&mdash;and it got
around&mdash;or anything&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;wish you&#8217;d see it didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
get back to my Dad. He&mdash;always said I&#8217;d get over bein&#8217;&mdash;shaky&mdash;when
the time came. But&mdash;Parson, would you
think it was awful wrong to&mdash;lie about it for me a little?
You see, it would cut Dad up like everything&mdash;and I
couldn&#8217;t bear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Black put his lips close to the young ear. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
have to lie, Joe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least doubt
of you&mdash;not the least. Do you get that? I&#8217;m telling
you the absolute truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the darkness Joe smiled. After a moment he whispered
back. &#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll have to buck up,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve bucked up now,&#8221; came back the whisper, and
Black&#8217;s hand clasped his arm tight for an instant. &#8220;What
a muscle you&#8217;ve got, Joe!&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>The arm stiffened, the muscle swelled. &#8220;You bet,&#8221;
agreed the boy proudly, and hitched up his cartridge
belt. &#8220;That&#8217;s what trainin&#8217; does to a fellow. Well&mdash;good-by,
Parson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God be with you, Joe! He will&mdash;remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;if you say so.&#8221; And Joe walked away,
less &#8220;shaky&#8221; than he had come.</p>

<p>Then, presently, it was the &#8220;Zero&#8221; hour. With the
first boom and crash of the covering barrage the men were
up and over the top. The farthest man in the line was
Joe. No, not the farthest, though Joe had been assigned
that place, for beyond and beside him, as he went over,
was Robert Black.</p>

<small>A SCARLET FEATHER</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sis</span>:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to cease setting down the big stuff for a space, while
I write to you. I&#8217;m just back with a whole skin from spending
the night up a tree watching this man&#8217;s army pull off a great stunt
in the way of a surprise for the enemy. I&#8217;ve sent off my stuff for
my paper and am now resting up&mdash;but a letter is due you, and
I&#8217;ve found a way to get it to you by special delivery. The messenger
starts in half an hour by motorcycle for your sector, and
vows he&#8217;ll put it in your hands as soon as he&#8217;s handed over his
dispatches to the C. O. So I can let myself go a bit&mdash;if I scrawl
fast.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had great luck this last month in meeting up with at least
three people whom you&#8217;ll like to hear about. First:&mdash;R. M. B.&mdash;by
the merest chance, for an hour later I&#8217;d have missed him. I
simply turned a corner in a little French town where I&#8217;d stopped
with an officer who was taking me with him up to the Front, and
ran square into a black-eyed chap with a cross on his collar who
was so tanned and so husky I didn&#8217;t snap to for a full minute.
He did, though&mdash;and had me gripped with a grip like a steel trap.
&#8220;Cary Ray!&#8221; he shouted. I knew the voice&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t forget
that voice in a hurry&mdash;and of course instantly then I knew the
man. Jolly! Jane, you ought to see him.</p>

<p>Well, he hadn&#8217;t a minute to spare for me, unless I&#8217;d go with
him. &#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an hour to spare while
Major Ferguson checks up with G. H. Q. here. What&#8217;s your
little party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a burial party,&#8221; said he, looking me in the eye, same as
usual. &#8220;If you haven&#8217;t had that particular experience, it won&#8217;t
hurt you, and on the way we can talk things over.&#8221;</p>

<p>As it happened I&#8217;d passed up the funerals, thus far, being occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
exclusively with the living and those on the other side
I wanted to see dead. Anyhow, it was worth it to have an hour
with this particular chaplain, whatever job he was at. So I went
along. I haven&#8217;t time to describe it to you here, but you can
bet it rated a special half column for my paper. It was a mighty
simple little affair, no frills, just a group of sober doughboys, a
flag, some wooden crosses, and a firing squad&mdash;<i>and</i> R. M. B.
reading the service. But don&#8217;t you think &#8220;the Resurrection
and the Life&#8221; didn&#8217;t get over to us!</p>

<p>On the way to the field and back I heard a great piece of news.
R. M. B.&#8217;s regiment had been sent back into rest billets, about a
fortnight before, and a group of entertainers had come through
the little town one evening and put on a show for them. It was
some show, and the bright particular star was&mdash;oh, you never
could guess if you hadn&#8217;t a clue, any more than I could. Well,
it was Fanny Fitch! Yes, sir&mdash;over here with a bunch of vaudeville
people, going around the leave areas and cheering up the
boys before the next bout. You should have heard the chaplain
describing the song and dance; I never should have thought it!
Fanny can&#8217;t sing a whole lot&mdash;just enough to get by, I judge;
but dance she can, and jolly she does, and the boys fall for it like
rows of tenpins. The best of it, according to R. M. B., is that she&#8217;s
happy as a summer cloud doing her bit. Why, she&#8217;s just plain
got into the game, Sis, as I told her to do, and I don&#8217;t know what
more you can ask of anybody. You&#8217;re nursing, and the chaplain&#8217;s
preaching&mdash;and burying&mdash;and if he isn&#8217;t fighting before he gets
through I&#8217;ll be surprised, knowing how pugilistic he can be.
And I&#8217;m skirmishing on the edge of things with my fountain pen,
and Fanny Fitch is making eyes at the boys and warming the
cockles of their tired hearts&mdash;bless her heart! And why isn&#8217;t
her job as good as any of ours, since it helps the morale as it&#8217;s
bound to do? All I know is I&#8217;m going to tear things loose and
get to see her as soon as I can make it, lest some nervy shave-tail
lieutenant get a line on her while my back is turned.</p>

<p>Time&#8217;s up. The third meet-up? You&#8217;d say it couldn&#8217;t happen,
but it did. It was a week earlier than this that I stood on the
side of the road and watched a couple of battalions march by on
their way to the training trenches in a quiet sector. And behold
there was a first lieutenant as <i>was</i> a first lieutenant, and his name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
back in the States was Tommy Lockhart! Talk about making a
man of a man&mdash;you ought to see our Tom!</p>

<p>Luck to you and love to you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Always your same old</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Cary</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>He finished it in a hurry, for the Colonel&#8217;s messenger
could not be kept waiting. After that he did some manipulating
and man&#339;uvring, which in the end resulted,
a few days later, in his getting the chance he wanted.
What Cary could not bring about in one way he could in
another, and more than one officer and man in authority,
if he had owned up honestly, would have had to admit that
a certain war-correspondent had a way of asking favours
which it was somehow difficult to refuse. Cary&#8217;s face was
his fortune, for it was the face of a modest but high-spirited
non-combatant who was afraid of nothing so that he should
fulfil his commission. Usually he was asking to be sent
to the most active front, and pressing his case; so now when
he wanted to make a dash to the rear, without explaining
why, those who could further his request were glad to do so.
It therefore presently came about that young Ray made
his trip in an official car, in the company of several officers,
with a number of hours to spare before the return in which
to hunt up a certain group of entertainers, which he meant
to locate or perish in the attempt. The more he thought
about that &#8220;shave-tail lieutenant&#8221; and others of his ilk,
the more eager he was to remind Fanny Fitch of his
presence in this new world of hers.</p>

<p>The hunt took so much time that it began to look as if
Cary&#8217;s usual luck had deserted him, when he came rather
suddenly upon his quarry. It was the edge of the evening,
and the edge of a French town in which was quartered
a division on its way to the Front. A big audience of men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
was seated on the grass watching a performance taking
place on an improvised platform, lighted with flaring
torches. At the moment of Cary&#8217;s arrival a young violinist
was playing softly a series of haunting Scottish airs,
and a hush had fallen over the listeners which spoke of dangerous
susceptibility at a time when men must not be
permitted to grow soft with dreams. But before this
state of mind had had a chance to make serious inroads,
the fiddler changed his tune. He dashed without warning
into a popular marching song, a lad with a concertina
leaped upon the stage, and a girl in a scarlet skirt, a black
velvet coat, and cap with a long, scarlet feather, ran out
from a sheltering screen. In her arms she carried a great
flaming bunch of poppies, and over them she laughed down
at her audience. Standing on the step below the stage
she began to sing.</p>

<p>It was just such a song as Cary Ray&mdash;and most of the
boys before him&mdash;had heard a thousand times. The
singer, as he had written Jane, had no real voice for singing,
only a few clear tones which, the moment the notes
of the song took her above or below the middle register,
became forced and breathy; but somehow that didn&#8217;t
much matter. She had a clear enunciation, she had youth
and a delightfully saucy smile, and she had&mdash;well&mdash;what
is it which makes all the difference between one such performer
and another&mdash;that elusive quality which none can
define, but which all can recognize? Spirit, dash,
beauty&mdash;they were all there&mdash;and something else&mdash;something
new&mdash;something irresistible. What was it? Trying
to discover what it was, Cary gradually made his way
forward, slipping from one position to another through
the seated ranks without ever lifting his body high enough
to attract attention. Nearer and nearer he came to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
front, and clearer and clearer grew his view of Fanny&#8217;s
laughing face. He didn&#8217;t want her to recognize him so
he kept his own face well in shadow, though he knew that
in the torchlight her audience must be to her mostly a blur
of watching eyes and smiling lips, and masses of olive-drab.
He came to a halt at length well sheltered behind
a young giant of a corporal, around whose shoulder he
could peer in safety. And then he looked for all he was
worth at the girl who was holding these boys in the grip
of her attraction, and doing with it what she would.</p>

<p>And what was she doing with it? What could Fanny
have been expected to do? It was undoubtedly her
chance to capture more masculine admiration in the lump
than had ever been her privilege before. There were a
goodly number of officers in her audience, mostly lounging
in the rear of the ranks upon the grass, but none the less
for that foemen worthy of her steel. She had every opportunity
to use her fascinations with one end, and only one,
in view. In satisfying her own love of excitement, she
could easily, under the guise of entertainment, do these
boys in uniform more harm than good. To tell the honest
truth it was with this fear in mind that Cary now watched
her. Great as had been her attraction for him in the past,
so great did he expect it to be for these others now&mdash;and
it had not been possible in that past for him to fail to
recognize the subtle nature of that attraction.</p>

<p>He studied her from the shelter of the broad shoulder
in front of him with the eyes of a hawk. Let Fanny give
these young Americans one look which was not what Cary
Ray wanted it to be, and he would steal away again as
quietly as he had come and never let her know. He
wasn&#8217;t sure that &#8220;R. M. B.&#8221; would have recognized what
he himself would, in the situation; and the fact that Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
had spoken with such hearty praise of Fanny&#8217;s performance
hadn&#8217;t wholly served to reassure him. She had
known from the beginning that the chaplain was present
in her audience&mdash;that would make a difference, of course.
She didn&#8217;t know now who was here; Cary would see her
exactly as she was. It was no chaplain who was watching
her now, it was an accredited war-correspondent with
every faculty of observation at the alert, his memory
trained to keep each impression vivid as he had received it.</p>

<p>It was a long time that Fanny was upon the rough stage,
for her audience couldn&#8217;t seem to have enough of her.
Again and again they recalled her, having hardly let her
pass from sight. It was difficult to analyze the absorbing
interest of her &#8220;turn,&#8221; made up as it was, like patchwork,
of all sorts of unexpected bits. Song and story, parade
and dance&mdash;one never knew what was coming next, and
when it did come it might be the very slightest of sketches.
It was very evidently her personality which gave the whole
thing its attraction; in less clever hands it might have
fallen flat. Yet through it all seemed to run one thread,
that of genuine desire to bring good cheer without resort
to means unworthy.</p>

<p>Yes, that was what Cary had to concede, before he had
looked and listened very long. Though she was using
every art which he had known she possessed, and some he
hadn&#8217;t known of, she was doing it in a way to which he
could not take exception. Though he was becoming
momently more jealous of all those watching eyes because
he could see how delighted they were, he grew surer and
surer that Fanny was definitely and restrainedly doing the
whole thing as the boys&#8217; sisters might have done it, if
their sisters had been as accomplished as she. His heart
warmed to her as it had never warmed before. After all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
Cary said to himself, this war had done something splendid
to Fanny Fitch as well as to everybody else. She wasn&#8217;t
a vampire, she was a good sport, and she was playing up,
playing the game, with the very best that was in her,
just as R. M. B. had said. And Cary was glad; he was
gladder than he had ever been about anything.</p>

<p>The moment she had finally left the stage, and the
sleight-of-hand man who was the other member of the
little company had secured the reluctant attention of the
audience, loth to let Fanny go, Cary wormed his way to
one side and out of the torchlight into the clear darkness
now fully fallen. He went around behind the screen, and
found a slim figure in scarlet and black sitting with violinist
and concertinist upon a plank, placed across two boxes.
An older woman with a plain face and fine eyes looked up
at Cary and shook her head at him with a warning smile.
Evidently she was in charge, and very much in charge,
of this girl who was travelling about France with men
performers among so many men in uniform. But before
she could send him away Fanny herself had looked up
from a letter she was reading by a flash-light the little concertinist
was holding for her.</p>

<p>She sprang up with a smothered exclamation of joy
and came to him. The older woman rose also and followed
her. Fanny turned to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an old friend, Mr. Ray&mdash;Mrs. Burnett.&#8221; She
made the introduction under her breath, for at the moment
the audience on the other side of the screen was silent,
watching a difficult trick. &#8220;He&#8217;s a war-correspondent,
and I&#8217;m sure hasn&#8217;t long to stay. Please let me talk with
him, just outside here.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, in a minute, when Cary had disarmed the duenna
with his frank and friendly smile, he led Fanny a stone&#8217;s-throw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
away, just out of the flare of the torches, and looked
down into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;here we are! And you&#8217;re playing
the game, for all that&#8217;s in it. I&#8217;m pleased as Punch that
you&#8217;ve come along. Tell me all about it, quick. I&#8217;ve
got to be back in the car that brought me in half an hour,
not to delay Colonel Brooks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there isn&#8217;t time to tell you all about it,&#8221; Fanny
answered, &#8220;and there&#8217;s nothing to tell, either, except
what you see. I am very happy to be of use&mdash;as I think
I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say you were. I&#8217;ve been watching you for a
full half-hour, and I never saw a jollier stunt put over.
In that red and black you beat anything in pink and
white I ever saw&mdash;to speak figuratively. You see&mdash;I&#8217;ve
only seen you in pink and white, before!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny laughed. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve never before seen you in
olive-drab. You&#8217;re perfectly stunning, of course. How
did you know I was here&mdash;or didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The chaplain of the &mdash;&mdash;th told me,&#8221; Cary explained,
watching her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; Fanny&#8217;s eyes met his straightforwardly.
She was made up for the stage but he didn&#8217;t mind that,
because he knew it had to be. &#8220;It was so strange to see
him, in uniform. He&#8217;s looking every inch a soldier, isn&#8217;t
he?&mdash;even though he&#8217;s not one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure he isn&#8217;t. Yes, he&#8217;s great&mdash;and you&#8217;re
greater! It&#8217;s all in the nature of things that he should
come over and do his bit, but you could hardly have been
expected to do yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Just because I&#8217;ve always been a frivolous
thing, is that any reason why I shouldn&#8217;t sober down now
and be useful?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>Cary smiled. &#8220;You don&#8217;t look exactly sobered down,
you know,&#8221; he told her, glancing from the dashing scarlet
feather in the little cap set at an angle on her blonde head,
to the high-heeled scarlet slippers on her pretty feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I am. I&#8217;m giving myself more seriously to
being a little fool than I ever did to trying to seem wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And in doing it, you&#8217;re wisest of all!&#8221; Cary exulted.
&#8220;Fanny&mdash;I&#8217;ve something to tell you. I wouldn&#8217;t have
been sure once, whether it was something that would give
you pleasure to hear or not, but&mdash;yes&mdash;I&#8217;m fairly sure
now. You knew&mdash;you must have known, what I used to
be, though you didn&#8217;t see much of me till that was pretty
well over. I want you to know that&mdash;it&#8217;s all over now.
I&#8217;ve had every sort of test, as you may imagine, since I
left Jane&mdash;and Mr. Black, and Doctor Burns&mdash;the people
who stood by me when I was down&mdash;and I haven&#8217;t given
in once. Perhaps I will give in, some day, but I don&#8217;t
think it. You see&mdash;I can&#8217;t disappoint them. And&mdash;I&#8217;d
like to think&mdash;you care too whether&mdash;I make good.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great burst of applause came from the ranks upon
the grass, followed by a roar of laughter. Cary drew
Fanny a step or two farther away, though they two were
already in deep shadow, made the deeper by contrast with
the circle of radiance cast by the torches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I care,&#8221; she answered, and he strained his
eyes in the darkness in the effort to see her face. &#8220;Cary,
I want <i>you</i> to know that&mdash;ever so many things look different
to me, over here. I&mdash;perhaps you won&#8217;t believe it,
but it&#8217;s true&mdash;absolutely true&mdash;that when I face an audience
like that one out there I feel like&mdash;almost like&mdash;a
mother to those boys. And I just want to&mdash;be good
to them&mdash;and help them forget the hard things they&#8217;ve
seen, for a little while.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>He could have laughed aloud, at the idea of ever hearing
anything like this from the lips of Fanny Fitch. Yet,
somehow, he could not doubt that there was truth in the
astonishing words, and it made him very happy to hear
them. There had been that in her performance, as he had
observed, which gave strong colour to this point of view.
Certainly, the experience of being close to the heart of the
great struggle was doing strange things to everybody.
Why should it not have worked this miracle with her?</p>

<p>&#8220;Fanny&mdash;&#8221; he felt for her hand, and took it in both
his, while he stooped lower to speak into her face,&mdash;&#8220;do
you know that you and I are a lot alike? It&#8217;s supposed
to be that people who are alike should steer clear of each
other, but I&#8217;m not so sure. You and I are always keyed-up
to a pitch of adventure&mdash;we like it, it&#8217;s the breath of
life to us. I can understand it in you&mdash;you can, in me.
Why shouldn&#8217;t we go after it&mdash;together? Why couldn&#8217;t
we make a wonderful thing of our lives, doing things together?
Why, if I could have made an airman, for instance&mdash;as
I&#8217;d have liked mightily to do if I hadn&#8217;t been
a newspaper man and had my job cut out for me&mdash;I can
imagine your being ready to go up with me and take every
chance with me&mdash;you could be just that sort of a good
fellow. And even on the every-day, plain ground&mdash;why,
dear&mdash;if you cared&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fanny was silent for a minute, and he could see that
she was looking away from him, toward the boys on the
grass, and the stage, and the torches.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go on doing this, while the war lasts,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;as long as I can hold out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you do. And I want to go on with my job.
We&#8217;re both taking chances. I don&#8217;t suppose a shot will
get you&mdash;but&mdash;one might get me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>&#8220;It might get me, too. I&#8217;m going next to some of the
hospitals, and they are shelled sometimes, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing. And the funny thing is, I shouldn&#8217;t want
you not to go, any more than you&#8217;d want to keep me in
safe places. Isn&#8217;t that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; She whispered it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he argued triumphantly, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t that prove
that we&#8217;re fit mates? And if we just knew that we belonged
to each other, wouldn&#8217;t that&mdash;oh, don&#8217;t mind my
saying it that way&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t that put a lot more <i>punch</i>
into our work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might.&#8221;</p>

<p>He well remembered that delicious little laugh of hers;
it had never delighted him more than it did now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that yours needs any more punch,&#8221; he went on,
rather deliriously, in his joy. It certainly did give zest
to a man&#8217;s wooing to know that a few paces away were
several hundred rivals in admiration of his choice. Not
one of those fellows but would have given his eyes to be
standing back here in the shadow with the girl of the
scarlet feather! &#8220;Punch! I should say so. How you
did put it over! And all the while I wanted to jump up
and yell&mdash;&#8216;Keep your distance&mdash;she&#8217;s <i>mine</i>!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;but you weren&#8217;t as sure as that!&#8221; Fanny tried
to withdraw her hand.</p>

<p>But Cary held it fast. &#8220;No, I wasn&#8217;t sure, not by a
darned sight. I&#8217;m not sure yet&mdash;except of one thing.
And that&#8217;s if you send me away to-night <i>not</i> sure I&#8217;ll go
to pieces with unhappiness and my work&#8217;ll run a fair
chance of going to pieces too. Heaven knows when I&#8217;ll
see you again, with the scrap getting hotter all the time.
I don&#8217;t mean to play on the pathetic, but&mdash;well&mdash;you
know as well as I do that this is war-time&mdash;and I&#8217;m green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
with jealousy of every doughboy who&#8217;ll see you from now
on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He hardly knew what he was saying now. The violinist
had begun to play again. The boys on the grass had
fallen silent. The torches flared and fell and flared again
in the light breeze which had suddenly sprung up. In a
minute more he must go; he must run no risk of making
the car-load of officers wait for him.</p>

<p>Fanny lifted her face and spoke to him in a whisper.
&#8220;Cary, will you promise <i>me</i>&mdash;that you&#8217;ll never&mdash;go back
to the old&mdash;ways?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d <i>like</i> to promise you!&#8221; he whispered back eagerly.
&#8220;I want to. That will make it surer than sure&mdash;if
I can promise <i>you</i>. I do promise you&mdash;on my honour&mdash;and
before&mdash;God.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood a moment in silence again, then Cary flung
his arms around her and felt hers come about his neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to promise you something, too,&#8221; her voice
breathed in his ear. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never, never face an audience
like this without&mdash;remembering that you might be in it.
And I&#8217;ll play&mdash;as you would like me to. Didn&#8217;t I&mdash;to-night&mdash;without
knowing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear!&#8221; How could she have known, and
given him what he wanted most? &#8220;Yes, you did&mdash;bless
you! And I&#8217;ll trust you, as you&#8217;ll trust me. Oh, I
didn&#8217;t know how much I loved you, till you said that.
Fanny&mdash;we were meant for each other&mdash;I know we were!&#8221;</p>

<p>Every man has said it, and Cary was as sure as they.
Perhaps he was right&mdash;as right as they. Anyhow, as he
went away, he was gloriously happy in the thought that
though those hundreds on the grass might thrill with
pleasure as the girl with the scarlet feather came out to
sing them her farewell song, not one of them all could know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
as he did, that behind the enchanting gayety beat a real
heart, one that belonged only to a certain war-correspondent,
already many miles away! Surely, if she could trust
him, he could trust her, and mutual trust, as all the world
knows, is the essential basis for every human relation
worth having. On this basis, then, was this new relation
established; and the augury for the future was one on
which to count with hope&mdash;even with confidence.</p>

<small>A HAPPY WARRIOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Field Hospital in which Jane was at work was
now seeing its busiest days. A steady stream of
wounded men poured into it, day and night, frequently
augmented after a serious engagement at the Front by such
a torrent of extra cases that every resource was heavily
overtaxed. Surgeons and nurses worked to the limit and
beyond it; they kept on long after they should have been
released. In Jane&#8217;s whole experience in this place no doctor
or nurse ever gave up and was sent to the rear until actually
forced to do so, by pure physical inability longer to continue.
It was amazing how endurance held out, when
the need was great, by sheer force of nerve and will.
Yet the strain told, and it showed more and more in
the worn faces of those upon whom the responsibility fell
heaviest.</p>

<p>At a time when the situation was most trying, and the
whole hospital force was exhausting itself with effort to
cover the demand, a visitor appeared upon the scene who
changed the face of things in an hour. He was a surgeon
from a famous Base Hospital, himself distinguished both
in America, from which he came, and in France, where
he had been long serving far in advance of most of his
countrymen. He had chosen to spend a brief leave from
his work in visiting various Field Hospitals and Casualty
Clearing Stations, and on account of his reputation for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
remarkable success in his own branch of regional surgery
his visits had been welcomed and made the most of by his
colleagues in the profession.</p>

<p>Arriving at this particular Field Hospital he found its
operating rooms choked with cases, its surgeons working
in mad haste to give each man his chance for life, in spite
of the rush; its nurses standing by to the point of exhaustion.
Their forces had been depleted that very day
by the sudden and tragic loss of their Chief, who at the
conclusion of an incredible number of hours of unceasing
labour at the operating table had dropped quietly at the
feet of his assistants and been carried out, not to return.
He was a man beyond middle age, a slender gray-haired
hero of indomitable will, who had known well enough that
he was drawing upon borrowed capital but had withheld
none of it on that account. His removal from the head
of his forces had had no outer effect upon them except
to make them redouble their efforts to fill the gap; but not
a man nor woman there who was not feeling the weaker
for the loss.</p>

<p>It was at this hour that Doctor Leaver, looking in upon
the shambles that the operating room had become, and
recognizing the tremendous need, a need greater than he
had left behind, took off his coat, put on the smeared
gown in which Doctor Burnside had fallen at his post&mdash;there
was not a clean one to be had in the depleted supply
room&mdash;and went quietly to work. He waited for no
authority from anywhere; he was needed for hurt and
dying men, and there was no time to lose. Comparatively
fresh because of his brief vacation from his own
work, experienced beyond any of the men who had been the
Chief&#8217;s associates, he assumed the control as naturally as
they gave it to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>&#8220;By George! I never saw anything like this!&#8221; burst
smotheredly from the lips of one of the younger surgeons,
as he received certain supplies from Jane&#8217;s hands. &#8220;Talk
about rapid work!&mdash;Why, the man&#8217;s lightning itself.
He&#8217;s speeded us all up, though we thought we were making
a record before. If anybody&#8217;d told me this morning that
before night I&#8217;d be fetching and carrying for Leaver of
Baltimore, I&#8217;d have told him no such luck. Why, say&mdash;I
thought I was tired! I&#8217;m fresh as a mule, as long as he
stands there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Leaver remained for five days, until a man to
take the dead Chief&#8217;s place could be found. During that
period he stopped work only to snatch a few hours&#8217; rest
when he could best be spared&mdash;if such intervals ever came.
His tall, sinewy figure and lean, aquiline face became the
most vitally inspiring sight in the whole place, the eyes of
surgeons, nurses, and patients resting with confidence upon
this skilful quiet man who did such marvellous things with
such assured ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; one nurse declared to Jane, as the two made
ready trays of instruments just from the sterilizer, &#8220;it
seems as if he had only to look at a case that&#8217;s almost
gone to have it revive. I&#8217;ve got so that I shall expect to
see the dead sit up, pretty soon, if he tells them to. That
red-headed boy over there&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t have said he had
one chance in a million to recover from shock, two hours
ago, when he came in. And now look at him&mdash;smiling
at everybody who comes near him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Doctor Leaver is wonderful,&#8221; Jane agreed, &#8220;But
remember who he is&mdash;one of the very most famous American
surgeons we have over here. And modern surgery
does do miracles&mdash;in the right hands. I never cease to
wonder at it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>One nurse was like another to the busy chief surgeon, or
so it seemed&mdash;they couldn&#8217;t be sure that he would ever
know any of them again if he saw them after this was over.
But on the fourth day of his stay, as somebody called
sharply&mdash;&#8220;Miss Ray!&#8221;&mdash;Jane noted that he looked suddenly
over at her with that quick, penetrating glance of his
which was keeping everybody on the jump. That same
evening, during the first lull&mdash;or what might be called
that&mdash;which had occurred for hours on end, he came to
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a message for you, Miss Ray,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you
are the Miss Ray who comes from the same part of the
States as a young man named Enos Dyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, Doctor Leaver.&#8221; Jane looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out here, please, where we can talk a minute,&#8221;
and the tall surgeon led her across the ward to an open
door. He paused beside her in this doorway, drawing in
deeply the cool damp air which poured in from outside, for
the night like so many nights in France was wet. He
passed his hand across his brow, smoothing back the dark,
straight hair, moist with his unceasing labours.</p>

<p>&#8220;My word, but that feels good!&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are
places in the world still, that don&#8217;t smell of carbolic and
ether.&#8221; And he smiled at Jane, who smiled back. &#8220;How
many hours&#8217; sleep have you had in the last forty-eight?&#8221;
he questioned suddenly, eyeing understandingly the violet
shadows beneath her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;As many as you&mdash;or more&mdash;Doctor Leaver,&#8221; she answered
lightly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve learned to do without, now&mdash;as you
did, long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody ever learns to do without. Get some to-night,
please, without fail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sound like a surgeon I know back home,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
said. She knew he would welcome a bit of relaxation from
discipline during this brief interval of rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? Red Pepper Burns?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, yes! How could you know?&#8221; she asked,
though less surprised than she might have been if she had
not already had many strange encounters, here in this
land of strangers.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the best friend I have in the world&mdash;as he is that
of plenty of other people. If you know him, Miss Ray,
you understand that my heart warms at the very mention
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;You knew how he wanted to come
over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! Hard luck. I wanted him badly with me. But
he&#8217;s represented over here, Miss Ray, in the best way a
man can be, short of actual personal service. I learned
from him a method of overcoming traumatic shock which
is more effective than any I&#8217;ve found in use here. It&#8217;s
about our most difficult problem, you know. I scouted
Burns&#8217; theory in the beginning, but I&#8217;ve had a great chance
to try it out over here, and it certainly does save some
pretty desperate cases. If I can ever get a minute to write
I&#8217;ll tell him a few things that will make him very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad,&#8221; she said&mdash;and looked it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for my message. Back at Base I had a case that
interested me mightily, not so much pathologically as
psychologically. This boy Dyer was under my hands for
a number of weeks&mdash;he&#8217;s back at the Front now&mdash;and a
more na&iuml;ve, engaging youngster from the back country I
never knew. He had us all interested in him, he was so
crazy to be under fire again. You had him here, I believe,
on his way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Doctor. I shall always remember him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>&#8220;And he, you, evidently. A number of weeks ago he
heard me say that I intended to take this trip, and he
figured it out that I might meet you. So he sent you
this message, with instructions to me to deliver it somehow
or answer to him.&#8221; He smiled over the recollection as he
drew out a small paper. &#8220;Dyer could get away with
more impudence&mdash;or what would be called that from anybody
else&mdash;than any boy I ever saw. But it wasn&#8217;t really
that&mdash;it was his beautiful faith that everybody was on his
side, including the Almighty. He had an unshakeable
and touching belief that God would see him through
everything and permit him to render some big service
before he was through. And since he hadn&#8217;t had his
chance to do that yet, it followed as the night the day
that he must get back to the Front and do it. I admit
I came to feel much the same way about him myself.
And when he gave me this message I understood that it
must be delivered at any cost. So&mdash;without any cost at
all&mdash;here it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane received the folded paper with a curious sense of
its importance, though it came from the most obscure
young private in the A. E. F. With a word of apology
she opened it, feeling that Doctor Leaver would like to
know something of its contents, if they were communicable.
After a moment during which she struggled with
and conquered a big lump in her throat, she handed it to
him. He read it with a moved face, and gave it back with
the comment:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great&mdash;that&#8217;s simply great! Thank you for
letting me see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The message was written in a cramped, boyishly uncertain
hand, but there was nothing uncertain about the
wording of it:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Ray</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>:</p>

<p>This is to tell you that it took longer than I expected to get me
fixed up again but I am all O. K. now and never better and I am
off for the place where things is doing. You know from what I
said that I think there is something for me to do that nobody
else could and I am going to do it if God lets me. Not that I
think I am a Daniel but there sure is lions and just now they seem
to be roaring pretty loud and I can&#8217;t get there too soon. I want
to ask you to pray for me not that I won&#8217;t be afraid for I am not
afraid but that I&#8217;ll be let to do something worth coming over here
for. The preacher Mr. Black said that God always hears if we
have anything to say to Him and I think He would hear you
speshally&mdash;because anybody would. This leaves me well and
hoping you are the same.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Private Enos Dyer</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have no idea where he is now,&#8221; Jane
said, as she carefully put away the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have an idea.&#8221; The surgeon was looking off
now into the night outside. Gusts of wind blew the rain
into his face, but he seemed to welcome its refreshing touch.
&#8220;I had a word with a young artilleryman just now on
whom I operated yesterday for a smashed elbow joint.
He doesn&#8217;t mind that in the least, but the thing he does
mind is that he&#8217;s sure his &#8216;buddy,&#8217; as he calls him, &#8216;Enie
Dyer,&#8217; was in that battalion of the &mdash;&mdash;nth Division that
has just been wiped out. It had taken the objective it
was sent for, and this boy has had to help shell the
position where Dyer would have been if the battalion
hadn&#8217;t been sacrificed. His idea is that it was a perhaps
inevitable sacrifice, but the thought that he might have
been pouring lead and steel in on his friend, still alive and
hiding in a shell-hole, has got on his nerves till he&#8217;s all in
pieces. He&#8217;s a giant physically, but Dyer is twice his size,
nevertheless.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find him,&#8221; said Jane. She felt suddenly weak with
dread. She had caught rumours before now of the battalion
which had not been heard from and which seemed to have
vanished from the earth, but she had no idea that anyone
in whom she was especially interested had been among
that ill-fated number. She had known young Dyer but
a few days, yet he had made upon her one of the most
deeply disturbing impressions of her experience. His own
personality, reinforced by her knowledge that he owed
this simple trust of his to Robert Black, had combined to
make the thought of him a poignant one. As she went
back to her work she realized that Dyer was not to
be out of her mind until the question of his whereabouts
was settled&mdash;if it could be settled.</p>

<p>And meanwhile&mdash;what was it that he had bade her do
for him?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was three days later that the rumour reached the
Hospital that the battalion which had been supposed to
be wiped out had been heard from. Two runners had
come through the enemy&#8217;s lines, it was said, and had
brought word that what was left of the four companies
which formed the battalion was under constant barrage
fire from the guns of its own side. The barrage had been
stopped, rescue was on its way; the daring men who had
brought the word would shortly be here to be fixed up&mdash;they
had been completely exhausted when they arrived.</p>

<p>The artilleryman sat up in bed. He waved his good
right arm and shouted, before anybody could restrain
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Enie Dyer&#8217;s one of &#8217;em! I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s one of
&#8217;em! Darn his hide, he&#8217;d get through hell itself if he
started to. He&#8217;d never know when he was beat&mdash;he never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
did. He wouldn&#8217;t know it if a seventy-five hit him&mdash;he&#8217;d
tell it he had to be gettin&#8217; along where he was goin&#8217;,
and he&#8217;d pull it out and leave it layin&#8217; where &#8217;twas! I
vum&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A burst of joyous laughter from all down the ward
greeted this triumph of the imagination. Then Jane laid
him gently down upon his back again&mdash;he had other injuries
than the smashed elbow joint, and sitting up
wouldn&#8217;t do for him yet. In his ear she whispered, &#8220;I
think it&#8217;s Enie too, somehow. But we mustn&#8217;t be too
sure yet. Just try to wait quietly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He owned her supremacy as they all
did. But for the next twenty-four hours he hardly
rested and never slept. Jane shared his vigil, while reports
continued to arrive, some adding to their confidence,
others taking it away. Finally, they knew that it was
all true and the lost was found&mdash;what there was left of it.</p>

<p>And then came Enos Dyer, and the Polish boy who had
been his companion. Five days without food before starting,
eight hours on the trip, exhausted but game, they
were brought back to the Field Hospital for the rest that
was imperative, and the treatment of minor injuries.
That night Jane sat beside Dyer&#8217;s bed and listened to his
account, because he was too happy to be suppressed until
he had told her the outlines. She looked at his thin,
exalted face, and saw the lines and hollows that hunger
and fatigue had brought there, but saw still more clearly
the triumph of spirit over body. She had managed that
he should lie in a bed next his big friend, and between the
reunited pair she felt like a happy warrior herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it was the <i>thing</i>, to start in the day time,&#8221;
insisted Enos, in reply to big Johnny&#8217;s comment on the
foolhardiness of this choice. &#8220;All the runners that tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
it before in the night got killed or wounded, and somebody&#8217;d
got to try the thing a different way. I figgered out
that in the day time when there ain&#8217;t any scrap on, the
enemy&#8217;s always half asleep, they&#8217;re so sure they can see
everything that&#8217;s goin&#8217; on. Nights everybody on both
sides is keyed-up like jack-rabbits, expectin&#8217; trouble.
But day times&mdash;why they&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to it&mdash;if they don&#8217;t
happen to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny chuckled: &#8220;No, <i>if</i> they don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Enos went on, &#8220;we made things safe by
leavin&#8217; behind our helmets and gas masks and rifles&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leavin&#8217; &#8217;em behind! Why, you&#8217;d need &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much we didn&#8217;t. Tin hats hit on stones and ring
out, when you&#8217;re crawlin&#8217;, and rifles and masks get in your
way. One officer stopped us, though, and told us to go
back and get &#8217;em. I didn&#8217;t want to, so I went back to the
Major and told him so. He said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you want &#8217;em?&#8217;
And I said, &#8216;No, sir, we don&#8217;t,&#8217; and he laughed and said,
&#8216;All right, go as you like.&#8217; He was the same that told me
when I and Stanislaus asked to go that &#8216;<i>if</i> we got through
we was to&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; &#8216;<i>If</i> we get through&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; I says to him&mdash;&#8216;we&#8217;re
<i>goin&#8217;</i> to get through! If God could take care of
Daniel in that lions&#8217; den, I guess He can of us.&#8217; He looked
at me a minute, and then he says; &#8216;You&#8217;ll make it.&#8217;&#8221;
Enos laughed gleefully. &#8220;Nothin&#8217; like standin&#8217; up to
an officer,&#8221; he said, by way of throwing a side-light on
the affair. Jane thought of Doctor Leaver, and wished
he had not gone back to his Base Hospital, and could hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s about all there was to it.&mdash;Gee, but this
pillow does feel good under a fellow&#8217;s head!&mdash;We crawled
down the hill, and across the valley, and we crossed a
road three times, right under them Fritzies&#8217; noses, and
they never see us. Quite a lot of times I thought they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
sure had seen us, and was comin&#8217; straight for us, but we
laid low, and every time they&#8217;d turn off before they got
to us, just as if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; his eyes met Jane&#8217;s and looked
straight into them&mdash;&#8220;a hand was holdin&#8217; back the lions.
I knew then just as sure that we&#8217;d get through. We
crossed three wire entanglements, and two German
trenches, and we run right onto a sniper&#8217;s post, only the
sniper wasn&#8217;t there&mdash;gone off for water or somethin&#8217;, not
thinkin&#8217; there was anythin&#8217; to snipe in broad daylight.
About dark it begun to rain&mdash;and it got black as a pocket.
We was soaked through. But we kep&#8217; a-comin&#8217;, and
quite awhile after dark we got near our own lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and drew a long breath. Jane laid an exploring
finger on his pulse, but it was not unduly excited
or more weak than was safe. Johnny, propping himself
upon his uninjured elbow, had to be made to lie down
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; muttered the artilleryman, &#8220;that was about
the worst of all. They keep an awful lookout, our fellows
do. Wonder they didn&#8217;t shoot you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought of that,&#8221; admitted Enos mildly, &#8220;so we
decided to keep a talkin&#8217; as we come near, so they could
hear we was English-speakin&#8217;. So we did. The outpost
heard us and challenged us, and we told our story. They
was bound to make sure we wasn&#8217;t spies, so they kep&#8217;
askin&#8217; us questions. By and by they called the corporal
of the guard, and after he&#8217;d asked us forty-&#8217;leven
more questions he took us back to Regimental Headquarters,
and there was some officers there that I&#8217;d see
before. I was surprised that they remembered me, but
they did.&#8221;&mdash;Jane was not surprised to hear this.&mdash;&#8220;And
then, well, there wasn&#8217;t anything too good for us. They
had some chow heated up for us, and they told us we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
have the best there was to sleep on&mdash;and we did&mdash;only
the best there was was the floor,&#8221; he explained with a
laugh. &#8220;This bed certainly feels good,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>That was his whole story of an exploit which had saved
a battalion. Seven hundred men had gone forth to take
the objective, two hundred and twenty-seven of them had
been able to walk out, when the rescue came. The
chances of a runner getting through the enemy lines by
which the men were surrounded had been desperate ones,
and Dyer had taken them and had come through without a
hair of his head having been touched.</p>

<p>He turned to Jane, lowering his voice. &#8220;Did you ever
get my letter I sent you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Enos. Doctor Leaver brought it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; he said triumphantly. &#8220;I knew you was
prayin&#8217; for me to get my chance, or I wouldn&#8217;t have got
it so easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane&#8217;s eyes fell before his.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did do what I asked, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he insisted, confidently.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t pray for that,
Enos. All I could think of was that you might come
through safely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>that</i> was what you prayed for?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, <i>that</i> wasn&#8217;t the big thing!&#8221; he cried, under his
breath. &#8220;Except, of course&mdash;if us fellows didn&#8217;t get
through the rest of &#8217;em wouldn&#8217;t. Oh, yes, of course,
that was what you did have to pray for, and I&#8217;m glad
you did. It&#8217;s wonderful how it works out, things like
that!&#8221;</p>

<p>She stole away presently, forbidding either of the two
friends to exchange any further talk that night. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
place was a little quieter to-night, though by to-morrow
the wounded from the rescued battalion would be brought
in and everything would speed up again. She went outside
the hospital and found a sheltered corner where in the
darkness she could be alone&mdash;until somebody should come
by. The rain had stopped, the clouds had broken away;
a myriad stars filled the sky.</p>

<p>After a time she took from her pocket her pen and a
letter blank, and coming around where she could get a
faint light from a window upon her paper slowly wrote
these words, afterwards folding and sealing the letter and
addressing it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I know, at last, that you are right. I don&#8217;t understand it yet&mdash;but
I believe it. Somebody does hear&mdash;and it is possible to speak
to Him. I have learned the way through a boy from the &#8220;hill&#8221;
where we went that last Sunday afternoon. He says you taught
him&mdash;and now he has taught me. You were right when you
said that I would find it all around me here. I have, but it took
this dear, wise boy to make it real to me&mdash;as you made it real
to him. So&mdash;it has come through you after all, and I am very,
very glad of that.</p>

<p>God keep you safe, Robert Black,&mdash;I pray for it on my knees.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was two days afterward that a despatch reached her
from Dr. John Leaver, back at his Base Hospital, near
Paris.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Operated to-day Chaplain Black &mdash;&mdash;nth Regiment &mdash;&mdash;nth

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>A PEAL OF BELLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY THE time that a certain note of a few lines, written
outside a Field Hospital window in France, had
reached a certain Base Hospital, many miles away, Robert
Black was able to open his own mail, for a fortnight had
gone by. He was so fortunate as to have two other letters
in this mail, a happening which of itself would have
made the rainy day much less dismal. But to find this
particular handwriting upon the third envelope was
enough to flood the ward with light&mdash;for him, though to
some others, near him, who had had no letters, it remained
a sombre place, as before.</p>

<p>He kept this third letter unopened till the morning
dressings were over, the carts of surgical supplies had
ceased to move through the ward, and the surgeons and
nurses had left behind them patients soothed and made
comfortable and ready for the late morning nap which followed
naturally upon the pain and fatigue of the dressings.
Then, when his neighbours in the beds on either side were
no longer observant, Black drew out the single sheet, feeling
an instant sense of disappointment that the lines were so
few. Then&mdash;he read them, and his regret was changed
in an instant to a joy so profound that he could only lie
drawing deep breaths of emotion, as he stared out of a
near-by window at tossing tree tops dripping with rain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
against the sky of lead. The sky for him had opened,
and let through a sea of glory.</p>

<p>Again and again, after a little, his eager eyes re-read the
words, so few, yet so full of meaning. Among them certain
lines stood out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I know, at last, that you are right. I don&#8217;t understand it
yet&mdash;but I believe it. Somebody does hear&mdash;and it is possible
to speak to Him&mdash;&mdash; You were right when you said that I would
find it all around me here&mdash;&mdash; It took this dear, wise boy to
make it real to me&mdash;as you made it real to him&mdash;&mdash; So&mdash;it has
come through you, after all&mdash;&mdash; God keep you safe, Robert
Black&mdash;I pray for it on my knees.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jane.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was well for him that this stimulus came when it did,
for within twenty-four hours arrived another message of
the sort which is not good for convalescents. Cary Ray
sent a scrawl of a letter from some post upon the Front,
which was three weeks in getting through, so that the news
it contained was already old. Black read it, and then
turned upon his pillow and hid his face in his arm. When
his fellow patients saw that face again, though it was composed,
and the Chaplain&#8217;s manner was as they had known
it all along, not a man but understood that he had had a
heavy blow. By and by he asked for his writing tablet
and pen, and they saw him slowly write a short letter.
These were the words he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart</span>:</p>

<p>I wish that this word I send you might be the first to reach you,
that you might receive the news of your boy from the hand of
a friend. But whether the official word comes first or not, you
will be glad to have me tell you all I know&mdash;which comes to me
through Cary Ray, and which he says has been absolutely verified.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tom&#8217;s division was one sent forward to replace the remnant
of two British and French divisions which had been long in the
field. The men went into position to hold the line under the
hottest possible machine-gun fire. Tom&#8217;s battalion lost all its
officers except himself and a second lieutenant, and these two
were forced to take command. They succeeded in holding the
position for many hours and until relief came, thus saving the day
in that sector, and causing the final retirement of the enemy.
The second lieutenant, Fisher, himself severely wounded, told
Cary Ray that &#8220;Lockhart was a regular bull-dog for hanging on,
nothing could make him turn back. His men would go anywhere
he told them to, for he always went with them&mdash;and went first.&#8221;
When he fell it was under a rain of gunfire, and there could not
have been an instant&#8217;s survival.</p>

<p>Though you have prayed many prayers for your boy, and they
have been answered differently from the way in which you would
have had them, I believe your faith in God is no less than before.
When Tom and his father meet again, some day, and talk it over,
it will all be clear to that father why his boy went home ahead
of him. But Tom knows&mdash;<i>now</i>; I&#8217;m very sure of that.</p>

<p>So, dear friends, you have a glorious memory to comfort you.
The gold star you will wear will be the highest honour that can
come to you. Nothing that Tom could have accomplished in a
long life of effort could so crown that life with imperishable
beauty, or so make it immortal. I rejoice with you, for the lad
was my dear friend, and I can never forget him.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Faithfully yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Robert Black</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Late that night, when all was quiet in the ward, he wrote
this same news to Jane. But at the end of his letter came
other words, of such joy and thanksgiving as a man can
write only when his heart is very full.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What you tell me of yourself goes to my deepest heart, as you
must well know. I knew it would come&mdash;it had to come. What
it means to me I can tell you only when I see you, face to face.
The thought of that hour shakes me through and through.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>On the 11th of November, at half after ten in the morning,
Jane was in one of the larger towns which had been
swept by devastating fires at one time or another throughout
the entire period of the war. She had been sent with
a certain Brigadier General who had been under her care
at the Field Hospital, and who had obtained for her a
short leave that she might accompany him and see for
herself something of this famous region. At the time
of their arrival shells had again unexpectedly begun pouring
in upon the town, though the rumour of the coming
armistice was persistent, and even the hour was given.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you go any nearer,&#8221; General Lewiston said
to Jane, as his car approached the town, and halted at his
order, &#8220;much as I want you to be there when the guns
cease firing. They&#8217;re evidently going to keep it as hot
here as they know how, up to the very last minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must let me stay,&#8221; Jane begged. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not in the least afraid, and I&#8217;d give all I possess to be exactly
there, when the hour comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave you here, in care of Lieutenant Ferguson, and
send back for you when it&#8217;s over,&#8221; the General offered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, take me in with you. I&#8217;ve been under fire,
before. We were bombed three times in hospital, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but this is different, Miss Ray. I&#8217;m responsible
for you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit, General. It&#8217;s my responsibility, if I ask
it&mdash;as I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He couldn&#8217;t resist her, or that sweet sturdiness of hers
which made her seem unlike the women for whom a man
had to be &#8220;responsible.&#8221; So he bade his chauffeur drive
on. Thus it came about that Jane had her wish and was
actually in this most noteworthy of French towns when,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
at the close of that last hour of roaring guns and bursting
shells, it all came to an end, as one graphic account put it,
&#8220;as though God Himself had dropped a wet blanket
over the crackling flames of hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, after that first breathless stillness which succeeded
upon the din, Jane heard that which she could never
afterward forget&mdash;nor could any other who heard it. From
the high tower which had come through scatheless above
the otherwise ruined cathedral, rang out a great peal of
bells. The cathedral doors were opened, and hundreds of
soldiers surged in. Jane saw them go, and called General
Lewiston&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mayn&#8217;t we follow?&#8221; she urged, and the officer nodded.
They got out of the car and crossed the space and went in
at the great battered doors in the roofless walls which still
stood to protect the sacred enclosure. As they went in
they heard the notes of &#8220;Praise God from whom all
blessings flow,&#8221; break from a young tenor in the very
centre of the crowd, and heard it taken up and grow and
swell till it seemed to lift above the broken walls to the
very sky. And then they saw the wonderful thing
which followed. If, before this hour, Jane by her own
experience had not been brought to her knees, surely she
must have fallen upon them now&mdash;as she did, with the
General beside her on one side and the Lieutenant on the
other, both with bared heads. For all those men before
her, British and French and Mohammedan and
Jew, had now dropped to their knees, and led by an
unknown man with a Red Triangle on his sleeve who
had lifted his arms to them as a signal were devoutly
saying together the words of the Lord&#8217;s Prayer. Such a
deep, whole-hearted sound it was which came from all
those brawny throats as Jane had never heard before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
She had heard men cheer&mdash;she had heard them sing&mdash;she
had never heard men pray together, regardless of sect
or creed, as she heard them now. And suddenly she
realized what she had never understood before, that it is
not one man here or there who believes that it is of use to
say &#8220;Our Father,&#8221; but that it is the great, all but universal
cry from every heart in time of stress. The armistice was
signed, the guns had ceased&mdash;it was the first deep instinct
of these men of every creed to speak their gratitude to
high Heaven.</p>

<p>There was singing again then&mdash;glorious singing of national
anthems, British and French and American.
Jane&#8217;s voice joined the General&#8217;s and the Lieutenant&#8217;s
and the three looked at one another. The General&#8217;s eyes
were wet, and the Lieutenant&#8217;s lips were trembling, while
Jane frankly wiped the streaming tears away as she smiled
into the two faces, which smiled understandingly back.
And presently they were out and away again, and the
General was saying to Jane, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you had your way,
Miss Ray, since you didn&#8217;t get hurt, for you&#8217;ve seen to-day
what must almost have paid you for all you have spent
since you came over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m paid a thousand times,&#8221; she answered, and so she
felt about it.</p>

<p>Things happened rapidly now. There was plenty of
work still for the hospitals, but it was of a different sort.
No longer did the ambulances bring to Jane the freshly
wounded. She was sent back to a Base Hospital, where
were the cases which needed long care before they could
be discharged. She had had more than one letter from
Robert Black urging her to keep in close touch with him,
before the one came which said that he was soon to be sent
home. He asked if it would be possible for her to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
leave and come to London, where the final days of his
convalescence were to be spent. He was walking about
now, he said, and&mdash;what it would be to walk down certain
streets with her! He added other statements calculated
to have their effect upon her, if only to make her understand
how very much he wanted to see her.</p>

<p>It was not easy to bring about, but at length she obtained
a four days&#8217; leave, and through the influence of
Doctor Leaver secured the difficult permission to cross
the Channel on one of the crowded boats. An early
December night saw her making the crossing, the wind
and spray stinging her face into brilliant colour, her big
coat-collar turned well up about her throat, her eyes set
straight ahead toward the English coast. It was almost
sixteen months since she had left England on her way
to France&mdash;sixteen months of the hardest work she had
ever dreamed of doing&mdash;and the happiest. Not one hard
hour would she take back&mdash;not one!</p>

<p>Dover, and many delayed hours to London, with post-war
conditions, crowded trains, upset schedules&mdash;and
always the wounded and crippled everywhere, that she
might not for a minute forget. Then, at last, Charing
Cross Station, and the lights of the great city, no longer
obscured because of enemy air-raids. As Jane came
out upon the street she drew a deep breath of content.
She had been several times in London, and knew her way
about. It was not far to the house where she was expected,
but she had not been met because it had been
impossible to know beforehand just when she might get in.
The days of making careful consultation of railway schedules
and then wiring an expectant friend the hour and
minute of one&#8217;s intended arrival were long gone by&mdash;and
had not yet come again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>She was keyed to a high pitch of expectation during
every moment of that walk. She was so near now&mdash;so
near! She was actually in the same great city. It was
almost unbelievable, but it was true. There was a
chance&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t be more than the millionth part of
one, but it was a chance&mdash;that at any moment she might
turn a corner and see coming toward her the tall figure
which she had last seen a year ago in August. How
would he look? What would he say? Would he be&mdash;different?
Oh, he must be different! He couldn&#8217;t
have been through it all and not have suffered some
change. But&mdash;she knew as well as she knew anything
in the world that in the way that mattered most to her
he would not be different, he would be absolutely the same.
As for herself, was she not different too? And was she
not&mdash;absolutely the same? Oh, no&mdash;oh, no! With the
development of her experience and the growth of her sacrifice
had not the thing within her heart and spirit which
was his become a thousand times more his? No doubt
of that. Then&mdash;might not that which he had for her
have been augmented too? The thought was one she had
to put away from her. Enough, if he could but give her
so much of his heart as he had given before. That of itself,
she thought, would be all that she could bear&mdash;to-day.</p>

<p>The old green door with the shining brass knocker she
so well remembered came into view as she turned into the
quaint little street not far from Westminster Abbey where
lived her English friend. On the first of her visits to
England, in search of rare objects for her shop, she had
met Miss Stoughton, an Englishwoman in the late thirties,
who had an established reputation as a connoisseur
and collector of rare antiques. Business dealings with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
this woman had resulted in a permanent friendship between
the two. Miss Stoughton was separated from her
family, all of whom were strongly opposed to her independent
establishment in business, a departure from all
the family traditions of birth and education. She had
chosen nevertheless to live her own life, and when the
Great War came to England she had a well developed
business experience to back her in giving her services to
her country. At the moment when Jane came to her she
had just returned to the little house, after a long period of
absence.</p>

<p>The green door opened at the first fall of the knocker,
and the tall Englishwoman herself welcomed Jane with
hearty hospitality.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear&mdash;this is most awfully jolly&mdash;to see you again!
How well you are looking! A trifle thin, perhaps&mdash;and no
wonder&mdash;but such a fine colour! Come in&mdash;come in!
The house is still a bit upset, you know, but you won&#8217;t
mind that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look upset,&#8221; Jane commented, after one
glance about the little drawing room, where a bright fire
burned on the diminutive hearth, and a tea-table beside
it offered refreshment, as if it had been waiting for the
guest. &#8220;It looks just as I remember it&mdash;the prettiest
room I ever saw in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear Jane&mdash;you are the same extravagant
admirer of my simple things. But I always appreciated
your praise of them, for you are not only a connoisseur
but an artist. And you have put aside all that to do this
nursing! Do sit down and tell me all about it, while we
have tea. But first&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she interrupted herself with a gesture&mdash;&#8220;let
me not fail to give my message&mdash;a most important
message. Morning, noon, and night for three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
days now, have I been besieged by a tall Scotsman in uniform
with the cross of a regimental chaplain. He had
what I may call a determined chin, and the finest pair of
black eyes I ever saw. It seems he also is expecting you,
but he fears you may in some way find it difficult to reach
him, or may lose an instant of time in doing so. He is
likely to receive orders to sail for the States at any time;
and I gather from his quite evident anxiety that if he
should be forced to leave without having seen Miss Ray
it would be to him a calamity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be one to me too,&#8221; Jane answered, with a
rising colour but a steady meeting of her friend&#8217;s quizzical
look. &#8220;How, please, can I let him know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A messenger waits within call,&#8221; Miss Stoughton assured
her, gaily. &#8220;Our war-time telephone service is still
frightfully crippled, so we provide ourselves with substitutes.
A small boy is ready to run post-haste through
the streets of London to carry the news of your arrival to&#8221;&mdash;she
picked up a card lying upon a priceless small table
of an unbelievable antiquity of which Jane had long envied
her the possession, and read the name with distinctness&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;<i>Mr.
Robert McPherson Black.</i>&#8217; A very good
name, my dear, and one which well fits the man. I
should judge he is accustomed to have his own way in
most things, at the same time that an undoubted spirit
of kindness looks out of that somewhat worn face of his.
I will despatch the messenger at once. Shall we make an
appointment for the evening, or are you prepared to see
your friend within the hour? He will most certainly return
with the boy who goes for him&mdash;if he is not already
on his way, on the chance of finding you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane came close to her hostess, and laid her hands upon
her shoulders. &#8220;Dear Miss Stoughton,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
sure you understand. If military orders weren&#8217;t such
startling things and likely to arrive sooner than one expects
them, I would put Mr. Black off until evening
and just have the visit with you I so much want. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do perfectly well understand,&#8221; replied Miss Stoughton,
decidedly, &#8220;and I should be most awfully cross with
you if you put off that very fine man an hour longer than
necessary. He has two service chevrons and two wound
stripes on his arm, and he walks with a cane; I should not
be in the least surprised if within his blouse he wears concealed
some sort of decoration. In any case he deserves
every consideration. A chaplain with wounds has done
something besides read the prayer book to his men behind
the lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>She left the room and sent off her messenger. Returning
she led Jane up the short staircase to the tiniest and
most attractive of English guest rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, though I am not married nor intend to be,&#8221;
she said, with the smile which made her somewhat plain
but noteworthy face charming to her guest, &#8220;I can quite
understand that you would like a look in the mirror before
the Chaplain arrives. You have always reminded me of
some smooth-winged bird, but the smoothest winged of
birds will preen itself a good bit, and you shall do the
same. Then come down, and we&#8217;ll be having tea when the
knocker claps. After that&mdash;I have an engagement at
my work-rooms&mdash;oh, yes, indeed I have! There is still
much to be done for our soldiers and yours, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane would have been more&mdash;or less&mdash;than woman if
she had not welcomed the chance to remove all possible
traces of her journey before the sounding of that knocker.
She made haste, but none too much, for Miss Stoughton&#8217;s
predictions were truer than could have been expected of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
one who must walk with a cane. As the last hairpin
slipped into place the knocker fell, and Jane caught
one quick breath before she ran to complete the
freshening of every feather in those &#8220;smooth wings&#8221;
of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s here, Jane dear,&#8221; Miss Stoughton presently
announced, as she followed her knock into the little guest
room. &#8220;I don&#8217;t consider myself at all susceptible to
bachelor attractions, but I will admit that I like this man&#8217;s
face and his nice manner&mdash;and&mdash;quite everything about
him. I&#8217;m going to slip out now, and let you come down to
find him alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please stay and have tea with us first, Miss
Stoughton&mdash;please do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am convinced of your sincerity and truthfulness,&#8221;
replied Miss Stoughton, &#8220;in all ordinary matters. I
should not hesitate to buy from you any rare curio in the
world on your word of honour alone that it was authentic.
But when you urge me to stay by my fireside and have
tea with you and a Scottish-American chaplain whom you
have not seen for considerably more than a year, I have
my doubts, my dear, of your good faith. I&#8217;ll see that the
kettle is boiling for you, and you, as you Americans say,
must &#8216;do the rest.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Jane laughed, her eyes glowing. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re such a
friend,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;But please don&#8217;t stay away
long. I want you to know Mr. Black&mdash;indeed I do. And
I&#8217;m so happy to have your home to meet him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My home is yours&mdash;and his&mdash;while you stay.&#8221; And
Miss Stoughton went away, beaming with kindness&mdash;and
experiencing a touch of envy. What must it be, she
thought, to look as Jane was looking&mdash;so fresh and lovely
in spite of her years of business life and these months of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
work and heavy care&mdash;and then go down to meet the eyes
of such a man as this who waited below for her? Miss
Stoughton walked very fast as she went through the
crowded streets; it was best to hurry to her work, and not
to think too long on what might be taking place in that
little drawing room of hers.</p>

<p>Jane came down so quietly that Robert Black would not
have heard her if he had not been on the watch. When
she caught sight of him he was standing waiting for her,
leaning upon the stout cane without which he could not
yet wholly support himself. Her heart, at sight of the
thin yet strong and undaunted look of his face, the whole
soldierly pose of him in his uniform, gave one quick throb
of mingled joy and pain, and then went on beating wildly.
It couldn&#8217;t be real&mdash;it couldn&#8217;t&mdash;that after all both had
been through they had met again&mdash;that they were both
here, in this little London drawing room. Yet it <i>was</i>
real&mdash;oh, thank God, it <i>was</i> real!</p>

<p>It was dark outside, but lamplight and firelight shone
on both faces as the two pairs of eyes looked into each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> you,&#8221; said Robert Black, after a moment, while
he still held Jane&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I can&#8217;t quite believe it&mdash;but
it is you. Will you mind if I look at you very hard, for a
little, to make myself sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure it is you,&#8221; Jane said. She couldn&#8217;t
quite return that eager gaze, but she could take stock of
his appearance, none the less, as a woman may. &#8220;You
must have been through very, very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not more than you. You are not changed at all, in
one way; but in another way&mdash;you are. It is the change
that I expected, but&mdash;it takes hold of me, just the same.
You have seen&mdash;what you have seen.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>&#8220;Yes. And you have done&mdash;what you have done,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have very much to tell each other, haven&#8217;t we?
And so little time, at the longest, to tell it in&mdash;till we meet
back home. I&#8217;m sorry to be going first, again, but I
have no choice. I wanted to wait for my regiment, but&mdash;I
suspect Red&#8217;s friend Doctor Leaver of having a hand
in these rigid orders to get out of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t the wounds doing well?&#8221; she asked him, with
the nurse&#8217;s straightforwardness which was so natural
to her now.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wounds are all right, but they left a bit of trouble
behind. It&#8217;s nothing&mdash;only a matter of time. The sea
voyage alone will undoubtedly work wonders. Have you
any idea when you will be coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Within a month or two, I imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; His eyes lighted. &#8220;But&mdash;Jane&mdash;I can&#8217;t wait
even till then to hear all that you can tell me of yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and sit down. And&mdash;may I give you tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed as she said it, and he laughed with her, a
note of sheer joy at the absurdity of stopping to drink tea,
when the time was so short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Stoughton will expect us to take it,&#8221; he admitted.
&#8220;It&#8217;s unthinkable that we shouldn&#8217;t bother about it.
Can&#8217;t we pour it away somewhere, where it will do no
harm? On the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And risk putting it out? I can never remember how
small an English fireplace is, in a house of this size, till I
see one again. Really, I don&#8217;t think it would do you any
hurt to take the tea. You&#8217;re not wholly strong yet.&#8221;
And she quickly made and poured it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to get it over,&#8221; he agreed, and took the cup
from her hand, drank, and set it down. &#8220;Now!&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
and sat down beside her. &#8220;Jane, I can&#8217;t believe it, yet.
I&#8217;ve been haunting Charing Cross Station for days. I
wanted to see you get off the train. I wanted to see you
before you saw me, so I could look&mdash;and look&mdash;and look
at you. It&#8217;s been so long to wait.... Well!&#8221; He
quite evidently laid sudden and firm restraint on his own
emotions&mdash;he didn&#8217;t mean to let himself get out of hand.
&#8220;Tell me all about it. You can&#8217;t know how I want to
hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you have first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begin at the beginning. Tell me&mdash;everything you
must know I want to know about you. How it began&mdash;what
came first&mdash;and what followed. And&mdash;most of all&mdash;where
you are now.&#8221;</p>

<p>They never knew how the hours passed&mdash;three hours&mdash;while
they sat before the fire in the little London drawing
room and lived again the year and more that had separated
them. But when at last Robert Black, looking in amazement
at the watch upon his wrist, rose to go, he was in possession
of that knowledge of Jane&#8217;s experience which had
transformed him from a convalescent to a well man&mdash;or
so it seemed.</p>

<p>He took both her hands in his, and stood looking down
at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very certain that my ship doesn&#8217;t sail before
Monday,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or I shouldn&#8217;t take the chance I am
taking. Jane&mdash;I haven&#8217;t said a word of what is nearest
my heart. I have a strange fancy that I want to say that
word&mdash;to-morrow. Do you remember that to-morrow
is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunday. Indeed I do remember it. I have thought,
ever since I knew that I was coming, that if I could just&mdash;be
in London on a Sunday&mdash;with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>His smile was like sunshine. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go to a service together.
Will you trust me to choose the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come for you in the morning,&#8221; he said. Then he
lifted first one of her hands to his lips and then the other,
said, &#8220;Good-night!&#8221; and was gone, with a military sort
of abruptness that was rather an emphasis of his former
self than a change from it.</p>

<p>It was easy to know what he had to say to her, that he
had chosen to defer until the following day. It had been
in all his manner to her; there was no need that he should
tell her it was coming; it was a most characteristic postponement
and a highly significant one. Why, since he
could choose it, should he not select the great Day of the
week on which to say the words which he was not less
eager to speak than she to hear? That he should do so
could but show her how sacred an event it was to him, nor
fail to make it quite as sacred to her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>IN HIS NAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MORNING, and the London streets, with Westminster
lifting its stately heights above them. Jane had been
quite sure that Black meant to take her there; somehow
there seemed no place where they could so much want to
go. Miss Stoughton had told her that all through the
war the great Abbey, like St. Paul&#8217;s, had been thronged
with the people who had gone, on week days as on the
Sabbath, to pray, as the new war-time phrasing had it,
&#8220;for those serving upon land and sea and in the air.&#8221;
And now, early as they had left the little house almost
under the Abbey&#8217;s shadow, they found the streets filled
with those who like themselves were pressing toward the
place where since the eleventh of November the nation&#8217;s
gratitude for victory was being voiced in each prayer and
song which rose from those sombre walls.</p>

<p>So presently Jane found herself kneeling beside her
companion, in this place of places which stood for the very
heart of England. More than once on former visits to
London she had entered at those doors, but then it had
been only as a sightseer. Now, it was as a worshipper
that she had come. Everything in her life was changed,
since those former visits, and she herself was more changed
than all.</p>

<p>It was in the midst of a great prayer, one not read from
the printed page but proceeding straight from the heart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
one of Westminster&#8217;s best-loved administrants, that Jane
felt a hand come upon hers. Fingers touched the fastening
of her glove, making known a wish. She drew off the
glove, and the bare hands clasped and so remained throughout
the whole period of kneeling through this and other
prayers. Strangers were all about, pressed close in the
rows of straight-backed chairs which were set even more
thickly this day than there had ever been need before,
yet Jane Ray and Robert Black were almost as much alone
in the midst of the throng as they could have been anywhere.
It seemed to Jane, as that warm, firm hand held
hers, that life flowed to her from it, so vital was the sense
of union. Though not a word had as yet been said, the
touch of this man&#8217;s hand seemed all but to speak aloud to
her of the love that was only waiting the hour for its expression.
The promise of that clasp was to her only a
shade less binding than the word that he should afterward
speak.</p>

<p>When the service had ended and they were upon the
street again, Black did not lead her home. Instead he took
her slowly about and about the place until the crowds
had left it. Then he said, with a gesture toward the nave:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we go back? There will still be people about,
but there&#8217;s room for all. I know a corner where I&#8217;m
sure we can be quite alone. Somehow, Jane&mdash;I want it
to be there. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up, met such a glance as told her that the
hour had come, and bent her head in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Church walls never meant so much to me as now,&#8221; he
said, very low, as they entered, &#8220;now, when the Church
has come into her own as never before. What does it
mean when the people crowd like that into her doors?
What did it mean when all those soldiers, as you told me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
crowded into that war-ruined cathedral? Why, it must
mean that the instinct to go where the Name of God is
most deeply associated with every stone and window is
something which is in every man who has ever heard song
and prayer ascend from such a place. He can&#8217;t do without
it&mdash;he can&#8217;t do without it.... And no more can we&mdash;<i>now</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said no more, while he led her down the great nave,
nearly deserted. People lingered here and there in famous
corners, beside distinguished name on statue or tablet, but
as Black had said, there was room for all in that vast
space. And presently they had come to a spot behind a
stone column where they were in sight of none, and all
were far away. Black took Jane&#8217;s hand in his again, and
himself drew off the glove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jane,&#8221; he said, with that in his low tone which spoke
his feeling, &#8220;it seemed to me that I must have our first
prayer together in this place. I came to Westminster
and this very spot, when our regiment was in London,
more than a year ago. I knelt here, all alone, and asked
God, as I had never asked before, that He would make Himself
real to you. He has done it, as you have told me, and
I wanted to bring you here and thank Him, on my knees.
Because now, we can work together&mdash;all the rest of our
lives&mdash;in His Name. Is it so&mdash;Jane?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not look up. Great sobbing breaths caught
her unawares and shook her from head to foot. She felt
his arm come about her, felt his hand press her face against
his shoulder, and there, for a few minutes, she cried her
heart out. He held her silently, and with such a tender
strength that it seemed to her that she had come into some
wonderful refuge, such as she had never dreamed of.
All the tension, all the weariness, all the heart-wrenching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
sights and sounds of the last year, had come back to her
in one overwhelming flood at his words, as they had come
many times before. But never, at such times, could she
let go; always she had had to hold fast to her courage and
her will, lest giving way weaken her for the pressing,
unremitting tasks yet to be done. In the old, ruined
cathedral a month before, she had had all she could do
to keep control and not suffer a very hysteria of reaction,
such as, alone among those hundreds of men, would have
done both herself and them a harm. But now&mdash;she
knew for the first time in her independent, resourceful
life, what it might mean to lean upon an arm stronger than
her own, and to feel, as she was momently feeling more
sustainingly, that another life was tied so closely to her
own that neither sorrow nor joy could ever shake her
again that it should not shake that life too.</p>

<p>By and by the storm passed. No longer did she want
to weep&mdash;a great peace came upon her. She stood still
within the right arm which held her&mdash;the uninjured arm&mdash;she
didn&#8217;t know that he could not lift that left arm yet nor
use it beyond slight effort. Now, at last, he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kneel with me, here? No one will see&mdash;and
if they did&mdash;everyone prays now.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they knelt, and Robert Black poured out his heart
in a few low-spoken words which, if she had still been unbelieving
that they could be heard, must have stirred her
to the depths. As it was, convinced past all power of
sceptic argument to shake, Jane&#8217;s own soul spoke with his
to the God who had brought her where she was.</p>

<p>With the last words his hand came again upon her cheek
and turned her face gently toward his. His lips sealed
his betrothal to her with a reverent passion of pledging
which told her, more plainly than any words could have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
done, that that life of his was now fully hers. It was the
life of no pale saint, she well knew, but that of a man whose
blood was red and swift-flowing, whose pulses beat as fast
and humanly as her own. But he had chosen to devote
that virile life to service in the Church, with the same ardour
with which, during these months just past, he had
given of his best to help defeat the enemies of that Church
and all for which it stands. No fear for her now that
service with him back on the old home grounds would be
dull or tame or weak; it would call for the best she had to
give. And she would give it, oh, but she would give it!
She knew, at last, that no task of his in that service could
seem to her uncongenial, if to him it was worth while.</p>

<p>As they walked slowly back up the long, quiet nave, it
was as from some high rite. At the door Robert Black
turned and looked back into the dim distance of the great
vaulted interior. Then he looked down into Jane&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done,&#8221; he said, with a smile which lighted his eyes
into altars upon which burned holy fires of love and joy,
&#8220;and never can be undone. And when you&#8217;re home
again&mdash;oh, please promise me&mdash;we&#8217;ll have&mdash;the rest of it&mdash;without
any delay at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise.&#8221; The smile she gave him back, he thought,
was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.</p>

<p>At the door of the little house under the shadow of the
great Abbey, Miss Stoughton met them with a message,
sent in haste from Dr. John Leaver, forwarding Black&#8217;s
orders to sail that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if,&#8221; he said, standing with Jane at the last moment,
alone with her in the small drawing room, &#8220;by any
strange happening this should be all that we ever had of
each other in this life, we have had&mdash;it all! Jane, we have
had it all&mdash;all the best of it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; she breathed it. &#8220;But&#8221;&mdash;she lifted her face
and whispered it&mdash;&#8220;I want&mdash;a life-time to say that in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I&mdash;bless you!&mdash;and we shall have it&mdash;somehow
I&#8217;m very sure. God keep you safe, my Best Beloved, I
know He will!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he went away, limping a very little with his cane,
but walking very erect and looking as if he had won all
the wars of all the worlds. He could hardly have been so
happy if he had.</p>

<small>THE TOWN WAS EMPTY BEFORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;OF <i>course</i> I&#8217;m going down to New York to see him in!&#8221;
shouted Dr. Redfield Pepper Burns. He waved a
cable message in his good right hand. &#8220;What did I wire
Leaver to wire me the date for, if not so I could be on the
pier yelling when that darn chaplain of the &mdash;&mdash;nth gets
in? Why, if Cary Ray&#8217;s word is to be trusted, Black&#8217;s
come through hell, same as the rest of &#8217;em. Be there?
You <i>bet</i> I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was there. Nothing could have stopped him. He
wanted to see instantly for himself that those shoulder and
thigh injuries of which Leaver had written were not going
to leave any serious or permanent results. Besides&mdash;oh,
yes, he wanted to see the man himself, his friend,&mdash;who
had faced death for him, as every soldier who went had
faced it, for those who were left behind. He wanted to see
Robert McPherson Black, and look into those keen, dark
eyes of his, and see break over the well-remembered clean-cut
face that smile which Red knew the first wave of his
arm would bring.</p>

<p>People on that pier had to make way when a certain
chaplain came down the gangway. A big man with a
red head politely but irresistibly put them aside from his
path, and they saw him grasp the chaplain&#8217;s hand. They
didn&#8217;t hear much, but they saw that two friends had met.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
The very silence of that first instant told the story of a
glad reunion.</p>

<p>Later, the words came fast enough. When Red could
get Black to himself his first questions were pointedly
professional. Satisfied upon the items he had wished
made clear, he turned his attention to making his welcome
manifest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to think I&#8217;ve lost my head,&#8221; he said,
in the taxicab which was taking the two men to their
train. Black was on furlough; the way had been made
clear for him to go at once, though he was to rejoin his
regiment when it came home later, pending his and his
men&#8217;s discharge. &#8220;But I&#8217;m just so plain glad to have you
back I&#8217;ve got to say it, and say it out loud. I knew well
enough when you went you wouldn&#8217;t play safe, over there&mdash;and
you haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just how much use,&#8221; inquired Black, looking him
straight in the eye, &#8220;would you have had for me if I had?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The two laughed, as men do when there is real emotion
behind the laughter. Red let his welcome go at that
for the present, and plunged into talk about the armistice
and the present condition of things. But late that night,
when Black having reached the haven of Red&#8217;s home, after
a quick journey by the fastest train over the shortest
route, was sent to his room at what Red considered a
proper hour&mdash;midnight&mdash;he had wanted to sit up until
morning, but he considered Black still a convalescent,
and now in his charge&mdash;Red gave his friend his real welcome.
To this day Black preserves a scrawl upon a certain
professional prescription blank, which was pushed under
his door that night just before he switched off his light.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>All the evening he had been made to feel how they all
cared. Mrs. Burns had given him the most satisfying
of greetings; the Macauleys had rushed in to see him;
Samuel Lockhart had called him upon the telephone to
make an appointment for the morning. His whole parish
would have been in to wring his hand if Red had not
kept his actual arrival a secret for that night except to these
chosen few. But nothing that anybody said or did gave
him half the joy that he found in those few words written
slantwise across the little white slip with R. P. Burns&#8217;
name and address printed at the top and no signature at
all at the bottom. Considering that day, now almost three
years back, when Robert Black had first looked across the
space between pulpit and pew and coveted the red-headed
doctor for his friend, and taking into account all the difficulties
he had found in getting past the barriers Red had
set up against him, it was not strange that his heart gave
one big, glad throb of exultation as he read these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<i>The town was empty before&mdash;it&#8217;s full now, though not
another blamed beggar comes into it to-night.</i>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Two months later Jane came home, to find Cary there
before her, with Fanny as his bride. They had been married
in Paris, &#8220;with all the thrills,&#8221; as Cary said, beaming
proudly upon the slender figure in the French frock beside
him, as he described the wedding to his sister. A few
days later Robert Black and Jane Ray themselves were
quietly married at the home of Dr. Redfield Pepper Burns
and went at once to the manse, which had been made
ready for them by the united efforts of Mrs. Burns, Miss
Lockhart and Mrs. Hodder, Black&#8217;s former housekeeper.</p>

<p>At the wedding breakfast, Cary, self-appointed master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
ceremonies, rose in his place. He looked around at the
little company, his eyes resting first on one and then
another, till he had swept the circle. Then he made a
speech, which he always afterward asserted to be his
masterpiece in the way of rhetorical effort, struck off, as
it was, on the inspiration of the hour.</p>

<p>Getting up in the correspondent&#8217;s uniform which it had
pleased him to put on once more for the occasion, since
Black, as yet undischarged, was obliged still to wear the
olive-drab with the cross upon the collar, Cary began:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In view of the fact that the bridegroom is still in O. D.,
it seems to me that it ought to be known to you people
what it looks as if he never meant to tell you for himself.
It&#8217;s only by chance that I found it out, but, by George!
I&#8217;m going to tell you, since he won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked around to Black, and laid hand upon the
topmost button of his new brother-in-law&#8217;s tunic. Black
put up a hand and attempted to restrain him, but it could
not be done, without a fight. He therefore submitted,
the colour rising in his cheek, while Cary unfastened the
tunic and threw back its left side, whereupon a certain
famous war medal for distinguished service became visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;My faith!&#8221; burst from Red&#8217;s lips. &#8220;I knew it! But
I never dared ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wearer of this,&#8221; Cary went on, while Black&#8217;s eyes
fell before the glow of joy he had caught in Jane&#8217;s, &#8220;went
over the top with his men every blooming time they went,
till Fritz finally got him. But before the shrapnel that
put him out at last left the guns he had brought in wounded
under every sort of hot fire, had taken every chance there
was, and that last day&mdash;turned the trick that brought him
this,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and Cary laid a reverent hand upon the medal.
&#8220;It happened this way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>&#8220;No&mdash;please!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began Black quickly, turning in
protest. &#8220;Not now&mdash;nor here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Cary wouldn&#8217;t be restrained. &#8220;Now&mdash;and here,
by your leave, Bob, or without it. I won&#8217;t go into details,
if you don&#8217;t like me to, but I will say this much: The
story concerns a machine-gun on our side which had lost
its last gunner, trying to put out a machine-gun nest of the
enemy&#8217;s which was enfilading our men and mowing them
down. This Bob Black of ours comes up, jumps in, and
keeps things going all by himself till&mdash;the spit-fire over
there was silenced. It may not have been the proper deed
for the chaplain&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;but I do know that he
saved ten times more lives than he took&mdash;and I say&mdash;here&#8217;s
to him&mdash;and God bless him!&#8221;</p>

<p>The toast to which all had risen was drunk in a quivering
silence, with Jane&#8217;s hand upon her husband&#8217;s shoulder,
and her proud and beautiful eyes meeting his with a glance
which said it all.</p>

<p>Then Black rose. &#8220;Sometime, Cary,&#8221; he said, with a
glance, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be even with you for this. Sometime I shall
have found out all the chances <i>you</i> took, and I&#8217;ll recite
them on some public occasion and make you wince as you
never winced under shot and shell. But while we are
drinking toasts&mdash;in this crystal clear water of our wedding
feast which is better than any wine for such an hour&mdash;I
want to propose one which is very near my heart. Not
all the war medals that ever were struck would be big
enough or fine enough to pin upon some of the breasts
that most deserved them. One man I know, who desperately
wanted to go across and take his part in the salvaging
of life from the wreck, but couldn&#8217;t go, nevertheless
contributed one of the most efficient means to saving life
that has been used by some of the best surgeons there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
And I want to say&mdash;&#8216;here and now&#8217;&mdash;as Cary says&mdash;that
I consider it took more gallantry on the part of this same
red-headed&mdash;and red-blooded&mdash;fellow to stay here and
carry on, as he did, with speeches and loan-raising, and
all the rest of the unthanked tasks that he put through
at heavy cost to his own endurance, than to have gone
across, as he longed to do, and won medals by spectacular
work that would have made his name famous on both
sides of the water. So here&#8217;s to Dr. Redfield Pepper
Burns, bearer of a heavier cross than I have ever borne,&mdash;and
winner of one more shining. And I, too, say&mdash;God
bless him!&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked into each others&#8217; eyes, these two, across the
table, and Red&#8217;s eyes fell before the light that was in
Black&#8217;s. It was not only the light that his wedding day
had brought there, it was the light of a friendship which
should last throughout these two men&#8217;s lives, and bless
both, all the way.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
